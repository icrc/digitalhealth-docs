# How will it be done: activities

1. Carry out a standard ICRC inventory: Do a standard ICRC inventory procedure, which involves closing the pharmacy for two days, with no stock movement (so ensure that beneficiaries have an alternative means to collect drugs during the closure).\
   An inventory team will count the stock accurately and make sure the stock, bin card and any existing management forms are all in accordance with each other. For the ICRC guide on the inventory procedure, please see this link\[MJHS1] .
2. Preparation of the pharmacy: Take this opportunity of closing the pharmacy to organise your pharmacy as it should be. International standards include that drugs are organized according to their routes of administration and alphabetically and in order of their expiry dates (for stock rotation and to avoid wastage). There should be a section of the pharmacy for disposables. All controlled drugs should be in a locked cupboard or box. Please see this link on guidance for stock management.\[MJHS2]&#x20;
3. Ensure the availability of hardware (tablets) and internet connectivity.
4. &#x20;Clinical Workflow Integration: Design a workflow of using PSM that integrates smoothly with current procedures while maximizing adherence to ICRC pharmacy management protocols to ensure the highest quality service possible and the highest acceptance by users as possible. Consult with the primary user (the pharmacist for example) to design the workflow.
5.  Plan training sessions: Train users on use of the tool (materials available from ICRC HQ) and changes to their workflow resulting from PSM, and any other booster training needed to use the tool (e.g., ICRC pharmacy management training if necessary). Train decision-makers to be able to find, interpret and analyse the data provided by PSM for their decision-making.

    ```
    Training: 
    Not only will users need to be trained in using the tool itself, but they may need to have booster training in the typical processes that the solution supports or skills they need for success. All users should be accredited and registered to practice in their domain and be up to date with all pre- and in-service pharmacy training for example.
    ```
    {% endcode %}
6. Briefings: You should brief the following colleagues, so they know that PSM is being rolled out and its objectives. Tell each group how this will affect/improve their work or what opportunity PSM brings. Hospital management; All facility medical staff (request that they are accurate in their stock requests, reiterate that PSM will not duplicate their work); MoH (to inform them and also discuss them taking over the tool at ICRC exit); Logisticians.
7. Support Structure: If third parties are using \[the solution], consider that ICRC service desk tickets need to be raised by the ICRC staff focal point.

\[1] These objectives should align with ICRCâ€™s health goals and local healthcare priorities and should be SMART:

* Specific, i.e. distinct and precisely defined;
* Measurable, i.e. include quantitative and/or qualitative elements that can be measured;
* Achievable, i.e. realistically attainable, including in the time frame envisaged;
* Relevant to identified needs and risks;
* Time-bound, i.e. establish by when the objective is to be achieved or a clear before and after.
