# Resources needed: Budget and Resource Mobilization

All activities need resources to make them a reality. Develop a budget that provides allocations for initial expenditures but also costs for the implementation and maintenance phases.

Outline main budget items:

* **Training Costs**: Account for initial training using ICRC materials for user training, but also any other pharmacy management training.
* Consider that while the pharmacy is closed for the inventory and organizing, you may need another solution or to provide more stock ahead of the closed days.
* **Infrastructure Costs**: Budget for devices, connectivity if necessary.
