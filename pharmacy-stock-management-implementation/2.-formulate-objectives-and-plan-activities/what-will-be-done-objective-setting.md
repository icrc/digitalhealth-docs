# What will be done: Objective Setting

Establish measurable objectives to guide implementation, covering user engagement and outcome improvement \[1]. For PSM, the main objectives are the following:

* facilitate ordering using the imprest system;
* enable logisticians have more visibility over pharmacy stock;
* improve logistics services;
* decrease the frequency of stock-outs.

See appendix 2 for the PSM result chain.

You may need to add specific objectives related to local need, e.g., reducing stock-outs of a certain class of locally important medicines (antimalarials) or reducing stock-outs of consumables related to a certain high-prevalence condition.

Add the relevant GOs and SOs to the objectives where possible.
