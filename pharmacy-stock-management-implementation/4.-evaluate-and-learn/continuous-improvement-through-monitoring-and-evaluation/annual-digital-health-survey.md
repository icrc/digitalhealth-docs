# Annual Digital Health Survey

The annual digital health survey will be sent to users by the HQ digital health team to assess solution performance and key areas for improvement, so make sure to include your users as part of this cohort. The purpose of HQâ€™s digital health survey is to ensure that the expected added value of the solution is sustained, guide improvements, and adapt management as needed.
