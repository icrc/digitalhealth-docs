# Feedback and Adaptation

Query users and logisticians verbally on their thoughts about the value of PSM. Use feedback loops to make iterative implementation improvements and enhance successful practices. These may be locally adjusted based on local user experiences and user satisfaction. It is much appreciated if you can share these successful practices with HQ so they can disseminate these learning to other or future implementors.
