# Exit Strategy and Long-term Planning

The exit strategy should be discussed at deployment with the MoH or the organization running the facility in which you are deploying PSM. If a transition to MoH is planned, develop a handover process with the Ministry of Health or local authorities to ensure sustainability. It may be that you need to work with the MoH on this over months to ensure its success. Please share all procedures and lessons learned with the HQ product owner to guide future deployments.
