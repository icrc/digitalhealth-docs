# Assess and analyse the now

Following the Results Based Management (RBM) framework, the first step is to understand the problem, for example:

* What is happening with medicines and medical items stock management in ICRC managed facilities?
* At what point in the supply chain are inefficiencies and failings happening?
* Which of those pain-points can PSM help with?
* What medical items are particularly important for PSM to include?

Once it is clear that stock-outs are at least partially impacted by lack of accurate data at the pharmacy and local logistics management level, you can be confident that PSM can improve the issue of stock-outs. You can then look into the need of specific facilities and how and where to deliver value through the deployment of PSM.
