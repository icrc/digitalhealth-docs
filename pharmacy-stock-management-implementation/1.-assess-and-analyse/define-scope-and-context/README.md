# Define Scope and Context

In addition to these broader implementation duration questions, on a day-to-day basis, the support service hours (for users who may have any difficulty with PSM) are available through ICRC Service Now between 8am and 4pm CET Monday to Friday. If users are non-ICRC users, there will need to be an ICRC focal point who can escalate requests via their ICRC credentials.
