# Pilot Launch

Deploy PSM in a phased manner, perhaps with one or two facilities first. Gather feedback from a smaller group of users to refine processes accordingly. As soon as PSM is perceived to add value and you are confident that your deployment process is effective, roll out more broadly. It is important to be transparent with stakeholders at all times of limitations or problems so as problems can be solved efficiently.
