# User acceptance and adoption

After the deployment, ensure that you accompany the usersâ€™ adoption of PSM, fostering their use sensitively. Show them data that confirms the value of using the tool. They will need to be supported to maintain their use; listen to the users through varied feedback mechanisms; monitor analytics around use of the solution and ensure that they perceive a return on their efforts and that you respond to their needs and expectations.
