# About This Guide

This guide provides key considerations for deploying and implementing PSM. Intended for coordinators or focal persons managing field implementation, it offers a streamlined approach, in line with the RBM framework, avoiding excessive detail. This guide promotes strategic analysis, proactive planning, responsive implementation, learning-driven improvements, supporting the effective deployment of PSM in diverse operational contexts.

Note that this is not a user guide or technical manual but a practical guide on key considerations for preparation and rollout of PSM. It is also designed with the goal of feeding into the knowledge base of a Generative AI chatbot that can support common questions that may arise during implementation.
