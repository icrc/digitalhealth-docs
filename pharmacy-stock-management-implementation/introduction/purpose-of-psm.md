# Purpose of PSM

Pharmacy Stock Management (PSM) is an android application for pharmacists or storekeepers to enter data on stock levels for improved planning and logistics processes. PSM addresses the need to improve stock management processes and avoid stock-outs of medicines and other medical supplies in ICRC supported health facilities. The primary objective of a PSM deployment is to facilitate ordering using the imprest system, thereby improving availability and efficient supply of medical items.

A user can either enter data monthly with the basic mode, or in real time if using the advanced mode. The data entered in PSM are then pushed directly into the logistics management system, ICRC Resources Integrated Solution (IRIS), for replenishment orders. Data also to to Tableau for stock data and Imprest level monitoring.

Through recording and data transmission with a digital Tool, PSM provides digital monthly stock reports through quality data entry to facilitate standard ordering using the Imprest System.  PSM Improves logistics services through visibility, quality monitoring of stock and improved planning and frees up pharmacistsâ€™ time.

This program aims to collaborate with local stakeholders to support adoption, and garner positive feedback from users, experts, and beneficiaries. The ICRC Digital Health program manager will be gathering feedback from implementers in order to further iterate processes and improve the Tool itself.
