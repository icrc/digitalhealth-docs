# Pilot Launch

Starting small with one or two facilities and one or two clinical domains will enable you to monitor and improve implementation processes.

Make sure that you have interviews or focus groups with both requesting health workers and tele-experts as well as beneficiaries. You will need to ensure that all involved were satisfied with implementation processes and outputs and that the use of TeleConnect does not impact negatively on the beneficiary-health worker relationship. Experts can comment on how manageable their workload was and be consulted on whether changes to the implementation processes are necessary. The IT support structure can also be assessed as part of the pilot in order to plan for scale implementation.
