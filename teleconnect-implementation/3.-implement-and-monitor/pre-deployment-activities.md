# Pre-deployment Activities

1. Training: All users of TeleConnect will have access to online training on how to use the platform and any additional support could be provided by the TeleConnect focal point or IT support.
2. Facility Preparation: For teleExpertise, the health worker should have access to basic equipment, drugs and consumables in order to carry out the recommendations provided by the tele-expert. These requisites can be set with the experts prior to deployment. Note that it may take some weeks or months to set up or ensure the supply chain.
3. Community Outreach: Inform communities of the upcoming changes and address any concerns proactively, especially around digital tools and remote service delivery (e.g., if there are suspicions around mobile devices or satellite internet installations).\
   For TeleExpertise, depending on your expert roster, it may be necessary to sensitize receptionists and the community to when certain expertise is available\[1]
4. Supporting operations: If a teleconsultation ends with a prescription being made, consider setting up a process for the prescription to be sent to the beneficiariesâ€™ pharmacy of choice. If a referral is made, consider having a process for the referral facility to receive the referral note electronically and explain to the beneficiary how the referral appointment will be set up.

Not only will users need to be trained in using the tool itself, but they may need to have booster training in the typical processes that the solution supports or clinical skills they need for success. All users should be accredited and registered to practice in their domain and be up to date with all pre- and in-service training.
e.g., For the tele-expert to feel comfortable in making decisions, to maintain their motivation and to ensure that the use of tele-expertise promotes quality care, it may be necessary to build or standardize the clinical capacity of requesting health workers in certain clinical domains through training. The expert needs to be assured that the requesting health worker can carry out standard assessments (e.g., breathing assessment or neurological examination) or procedures that the expert recommends (e.g., placing an IV line or a chest-drain). These minimum clinical skill sets can be set with the group of tele-experts, and if necessary, offer training sessions prior to using TeleConnect.
