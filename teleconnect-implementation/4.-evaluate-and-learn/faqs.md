# FAQs

**What are the advantages of using TeleConnect?**

Email and WhatsApp are not safe ways to communicate sensitive and confidential health data. Additionally, the health worker’s or expert’s contact details are visible to those on the call or in the email thread. TeleConnect provides a secure platform for information exchange and consultations. It can’t be intercepted as a cellular phone call can.

TeleConnect also provides a PDF consultation summary, detailing the time of the contacts and any information written in the chat (diagnosis, treatment plans, etc). This summary can be added to the patient record (paper or electronic).

**Who is TeleConnect for?**

Any beneficiary, ICRC staff or partner who wishes to set up a safe and secure means of communication for sensitive information. (Protection are using TeleConnect for the missing person’s desk, for example.) Health is a natural use for TeleConnect, because beneficiaries often experience care access issues and the communication of health information needs to be private.

Experts can provide lower cadres of health care providers with their expert advice for clinical decision making and case management support.

Any health worker can use TeleConnect to conduct a distance consultation with a beneficiary.

**How much does it cost to deploy TeleConnect?**

TeleConnect requires battery powered devices that have a camera and access to the internet. It may be necessary to procure further devices, internet (wifi, 4G or 5G or satellite internet), or the user can use their own device.

If TeleExpertise is to be deployed, it may be necessary to incentivize the pool of experts to remain available for TeleConnect consultations, which would need to be budgeted.

Finally, a focal point will be necessary to coordinate the deployment and manage user accounts (through a very easy to use administrator profile within TeleConnect).

**How do I train users?**

Users will receive training videos on how to use the tool. It isn’t very complicated, and a support person should be available to help from 2025.

If TeleExpertise is deployed, it may be necessary to ensure that receivers of medical advice (i.e., the health worker requesting support) are skilled enough to carry out the examination they may be asked to do by the specialist or to act on the advice they are being given. For example, in trauma care, being able to place a chest drain, or in ANC being able to measure the fundal height. This may require booster training for skills learned pre-service or ensuring they have done certain post-service trainings.
