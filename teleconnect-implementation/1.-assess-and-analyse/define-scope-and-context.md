# Define Scope and Context

* Identify Target Populations: Which populations are in need of connection with a health practitioner? What is the level of digital literacy of beneficiaries to be able to connect to a TeleConnect call? What devices do they use to access the internet?
* Geographic Area and Facility Capacity: Consider the skill and knowledge of potential health workers users, the facility current clinical capacity, connectivity, their access to medicines, PoC testing or lab services and their referral pathways.
* Health problems or clinical domains that the tele-expertise system will address: Consider the prevalence of the health problems and the current lacking clinical capacity to address them and whether the health problem is possible to address remotely with current resources.
* Service duration scope and Availability: During which hours will the service be available? Does the service only run with pre-scheduled session times, or would calls wait in a queue on first come-first served basis? What should be the maximum response-time for expert advice (in the case for TeleExpertise) to have added value? e.g., 1 hour, 10 hours?\
  \
  The duration of the implementation of TeleConnect may differ depending on the maturity of other telemedicine initiatives in the country or the interest of the MoH to take the tool on. It may be that the ICRC tool is being used to bridge a perceived short-term access problem or until the health authority can implement an existing solution. It may be that the government would like to take over the implementation and hosting of the solution as part of their digital health transformation activities.
* Expected outcome and added value: Telemedicine not only has a positive impact on care coverage and access to care, but it can also have positive environmental impacts, reducing the need for travel to access healthcare. TeleConnect can provide analytics on how many beneficiaries have had a consultation or received TeleExpertise with TeleConnect, so reporting on the added value of TeleConnect is possible.

Tele-Expertise specific considerations:

* TeleExpertise: Think about which type of health workers will consult experts through TeleConnect. Consider their digital literacy, minimum necessary skills to implement the advice they receive and how TeleConnect will fit in the workflow of the health worker. These health workers should be nationally registered practicing clinicians (or authorized if registered in another country) and up to date with all pre- and in-service training.
* Expert advisor characteristics: Experts should also have the necessary accreditation in a specialist field or other minimum credentials. Consider also their digital literacy, languages spoken etc.
