# Stakeholder Engagement

Communicate benefits and address potential resistance. Onboard key stakeholders. Engage these stakeholders and introduce them to their role in the success of tele-expertise implementation. If the health authorities require local governance of the tele-expertise program, work with the MoH and in accordance with their processes and procedures. _See appendix 1 for an example stakeholder analysis table._
