# User Capacity and Competency

Ensure users have foundational knowledge of the clinical domain in which TeleConnect is being used. To ensure quality service delivery and to assist experts as much as possible, users should have a minimum standard of clinical knowledge and skills to be able to provide quality information to the expert for them to base their clinical recommendation on. It may be necessary to run training to ensure that users all have a basic level of medical skill and knowledge. In the end, the responsibility and accountability for patient outcomes lies with the non-expert user of the solution, as with any medical action. So with this in mind, it will be necessary to arrange training to support both the toolâ€™s functions (how to use TeleConnect) but also clinical booster training or training on related processes.
