# Telemedicine policy and Data Policy Compliance

Be sure to design the project in line with national digital health, data, or other privacy policies. If there are no relevant policies, assess with the health authorities how they would like to move forward. Consider implications for cross-jurisdictional flow of information (inter-regionally or internationally in the case of cross border telemedicine).
