# Sustainability considerations

Consider potential government handover or ICRC exit from implementing facilities in a post emergency context. If existing, ensure alignment with national digital health strategies from Ministries of Health or digital transformation strategies from the Ministry of Technology or Telecommunication equivalents. Otherwise consider if other delegations had previous success in conducting such handovers to partner national societies or other entities.
