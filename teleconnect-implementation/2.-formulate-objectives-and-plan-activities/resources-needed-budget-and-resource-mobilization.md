# Resources needed: Budget and Resource Mobilization

The main budget items for TeleConnect are:

* A TeleConnect focal point (funding needed if the delegation or MoH cannot absorb this),
* TeleConnect online training
* Skills training for requesting health workers in the case of training needs in a TeleExpertise deployment
* Ensuring supply of essential medicines and equipment
* Hardware (mobile devices if users arenâ€™t using their own or existing devices) and internet connection (e.g., strengthening connectivity, satellite internet if necessary.

In the case of TeleExpertise, it may be necessary to incentivize the expert, and depending on processes and expectations in-country, you may need to add this to the budget.

Consider approaching telecoms companies in your country to see if they would partner on providing 4G or other infrastructure at minimal or no cost. Develop a budget that provides allocations for initial expenditures but also costs for the implementation and maintenance phases. There may also be costs that spread across phases, such as those associated with governance meetings and human resources.

The deployment budget will grow proportionally to the number of users you envisage and can be added to your PfR, or you can explore other financing mechanisms.
