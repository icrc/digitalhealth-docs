# 2. TeleExpertise: Engage and convene your tele-experts

If you will be providing TeleExpertise, ensure that your experts have buy-in (e.g., put a mechanism in place for them to receive their identified incentive if relevant) and are involved in decisions around how they are managed or coordinated through an initial consultation meeting. The agenda of the initial consultation meeting could include co-developing the roster of staffing the tele-expertise line, ensuring they understand the realities of the skills and resources in the health facilities they are supporting, the queuing system and the expectation of their involvement. Identify a focal point to manage the roster and send experts reminders to ensure their availability.\
Consider quarterly community of practice meetings for experts as way to maintain engagement and sharing lessons learned and gathering feedback.
