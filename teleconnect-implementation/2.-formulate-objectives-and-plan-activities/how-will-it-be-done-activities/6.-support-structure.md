# 6. Support Structure

Based on the support resources you have available to you, define how users will get IT and functional support. The ICRC support chatbot should be available to ICRC staff in early 2025. For non-ICRC users, it will be necessary, to have an ICRC user account to access field IT and L2 and L3 support (user additions and accounts management, other IT issues). If non-ICRC users are using Tele-Connect, the ICRC TeleConnect focal point will have to contact Support Now to raise a ticket on behalf of the user.
