# 3. Clinical Workflow Integration

The features of TeleConnect are:

* Basic patient data entry at “invite beneficiary” stage or “request expertise” stage
* Upload of documents or images
* Secure video or audio calling
* Chat function while a session remains open
* All data is deleted 24 hours after a consultation is closed

Consider how to incorporate telemedicine with the least amount of workflow disruption, especially at first, to help seamlessly introduce the technology at the facility.

For TeleConsultations (provider to beneficiary), identify who will set up the calls with beneficiaries…The health worker themselves (e.g., for follow up appointments)? A receptionist at the peripheral health facility? A mobile community outreach nurse? Will beneficiaries be able to email the facility to request a TeleConsultation?
