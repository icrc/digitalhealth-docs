# Purpose of TeleConnect

ICRC TeleConnect is an ICRC-approved secure communication platform for Telemedicine. Telemedicine is the distal exchange of health information between patient and health care provider (Teleconsultations) or between two or more health care providers (TeleExpertise). The program target should be to work with local stakeholders to improve access to quality health care with positive feedback from users, experts and beneficiaries.

The objectives of TeleConnect are to

* Provide a secure communication platform for beneficiaries to access distal care, or for health workers to consult with medical specialists for decision support.
* Increase access to care for beneficiaries
* Increase quality of care in peripheral health facilities
* To maintain user satisfaction with TeleConnect

If you are reading this, you believe that the TeleConnect solution could bridge the gap of access to quality health care or expertise and have identified that all users have a stable internet connection, that there is a geographical or security barrier to access to health care or that there is a barrier to providing expert medical care where needed.
