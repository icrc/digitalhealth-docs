How to Modify an Existing Dashboard Item?

Very often you need to extract data and present it in a specific way and layout. The dashboard items available in the MAD may provide exactly what you need, or you may need to apply modifications to obtain the expected results.

With the steps explained here below, you can work on the already existing items and avoid creating new ones from scratch.

Letʼs say, you want data on permanent, mobile and temporary first aid posts supported, and the total in Q 3 2022 , in Pakistan per region.

Which dashboard contains this information? By default, in the new MAD a dashboard called “aggregation of data” is available for every health program. This dashboard contains all he indicators across all data sets.

&#x20;To answer the request above, you may select FA\&PHEC aggregation of data. In particular, the table “FA Structures” contains several indicators, among which, the ones under question.

Click on the three-dot icon at first, and then on “Open in Data Visualizer app”. You will get directed to the following page containing a selection of data (elements and indicators), period and organisation unit.&#x20;

It is possible to change the criteria of your choice based on your specific needs. Let’s start from the indicators   you are looking for. Click on “Data”&#x20;

Click on “Organisation Unit”.&#x20;

Untick the “User organisation unit”, which is set by default (1). Open to select a level (2), click on “Region” (3), to see data per region in the country. In case you want to see data per population (PHC only) or facility, select the corresponding level.&#x20;

Click on Update.&#x20;

If you select more than one level, be aware that the table you will get will display data at both levels and the lower level will be included in the higher level.&#x20;

The first 2 rows in the table are Regions. The data from these two rows are also displayed by Facility in the rows below.&#x20;

Attention: in this case do not apply Column totals as the data will be duplicated&#x20;
