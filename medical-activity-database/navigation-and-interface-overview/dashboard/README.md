    Selection of Organisation Unit \
    By default, most of the dashboards are configurated to display data at the highest level of your access. For example, if you have access to country data the dashboards will present data aggregated for the entire country. When you are interested in data coming from more specific organisation units such as, first administration level(s), population(s), structure(s), you can apply the filters as indicated below. Open “Add filter” and click on “Organisation Unit”.&#x20;

    2.a. How to Modify an Existing Dashboard Item? \
    &#x20;             Very often you need to extract data and present it in a specific way and layout. The dashboard items available in        the MAD may provide exactly what you need, or you may need to apply modifications to obtain the expected results. With the steps explained here below, you can work on the already existing items and avoid creating new               ones from scratch. Let’s say, you want data on permanent, mobile and temporary first aid posts supported, and   the total in Q3 2022, in Pakistan per region. Which dashboard contains this information? By default, in the new       MAD a dashboard called “aggregation of data” is available for every health program. This dashboard contains all              the indicators across all data sets.&#x20;

    To answer the request above, you may select FA\&PHEC aggregation of data. In particular, the table “FA                          structructures” contains several indicators, among which, the ones under question.&#x20;

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (56).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    Click on the three-dot icon at first, and then on “Open in Data Visualizer app”. You will get directed to the            following page containing a selection of data (elements and indicators), period and organisation unit.&#x20;

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (57).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    It is possible to change the criteria of your choice based on your specific needs. Let’s start from the indicators   you are looking for. Click on “Data”&#x20;

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (58).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    You get the following report containing the data you selected. \
    ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (59).png>)

    How many permanent, mobile and temporary first aid posts were supported, in Q3 2022, in Pakistan per                             region?”.&#x20;

    Click on “Organisation Unit”.&#x20;

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    Untick the “User organisation unit”, which is set by default (1). Open to select a level (2), click on “Region” (3), to          see data per region in the country. In case you want to see data per population (PHC only) or facility, select the          corresponding level. Click on Update.&#x20;

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    If you select more than one level, be aware that the table you will get will display data at both levels and the        lower level will be included in the higher level.&#x20;

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (62).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    The first 2 rows in the table are Regions. The data from these two rows are also displayed by Facility in the rows           below. Attention: in this case do not apply Column totals as the data will be duplicated&#x20;
