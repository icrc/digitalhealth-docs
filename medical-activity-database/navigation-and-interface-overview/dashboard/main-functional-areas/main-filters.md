# Main Filters

**Selection of Period** \
All the dashboards have been configurated for a period and at organisation unit level. However, you can modify these by using the filters as indicated below. Open “Add filter” and click on “Period”.

**Selection of organization unit**

By default, most of the dashboards are configurated to display data at the highest level of your access. For example, if you have access to country data the dashboards will present data aggregated for the entire country. When you are interested in data coming from more specific organisation units such as, first administration level(s), population(s), structure(s), you can apply the filters as indicated below. Open “Add filter” and click on “Organisation Unit”.

There are seven levels in the hierarchy as displayed in the table. Please note that all levels apply the same way to all Health Programs except for the Population level, which is mostly relevant for PHC. The other programs need to open their structures under the “Generic” region level as indicated below:

At which level are monthly reports entered? The table here displayed shows the Data sets available at each level.

When you extract aggregated data, be aware that all indicators monitored at service delivery point level can be aggregated to all levels above, but the opposite cannot happen.

Example: PRP scholarships are entered in the PRP Country form on a yearly basis. You can extract the number of scholarships for one or more countries over one or more years, but it is impossible to know the number of scholarships per structure per month.
