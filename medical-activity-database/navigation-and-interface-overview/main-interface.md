# Dashboard

Where to find it:&#x20;

click on the dot-square icon on the topright corner. You may also type a few letters in the “Search apps” window to find the Dashboard app more easily

Compared to the old MAD, dashboards in DHIS2 are what we used to call “overviews”. In the old MAD it was possible to generate overviews by applying some filters such as period, locations, the kind of desired overview, and then the system provided excel files. In DHIS2, dashboards are already available when you log in the application and can also be considered as a home page. In the following pages, we will be walking through main features. By default, in your user profile you are given access for data visualization to your country or region depending on your needs.

Once in Dashboards app, here is an example of the landing page. Each dashboard contains a summary providing a description of its content. By clicking on the arrow indicated in the image here above, you expand or reduce the window, and more or fewer dashboards are displayed

Important notes:

1. In the new MAD all users have access to all the structures configured in the past and present years and are available in the organisation unit tree.
2. Facility Level: Hospital \[HOS], Health Center \[HC], Mobile Health Unit \[MHU], Place of Detention \[DET], Physical Rehabilitation Center \[PRC], Government Entity \[GOV], National Society Location \[NSL], FA\&PHEC specific structures \[FAPHEC], MHPSS specific structures \[MHPSS L6].
3. Service Delivery Point: HSP, PHC, HCD, PRP, FA\&PHEC, MHPSS. In many cases, under one structure there are multiple service delivery points. This is valid for structures where more than one health programs provide support. For instance, a hospital having hospital activities, MHPSS, FA\&PHEC.
