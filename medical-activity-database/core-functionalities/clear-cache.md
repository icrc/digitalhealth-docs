# Clear Cache

### INTRODUCTION

The Browser Cache Cleaner is the application within the new MAD/DHIS2, that can be used to

clear the cache and ensure that DHIS2 is working with up-to-date information. You can also

clean cache in your browser directly. Both options will be explained below.

### STEP 1: CLEAR CACHE IN THE MAD/DHIS2

Click on the Main menu icon ( ) in the top right corner, as in the screen shot below. Then

click on the Browser Cache cleaner.

In the newly opened view, click on _Select all_ and finally go to _Clear all selected items_ , either at

the top or bottom of the page. This will ensure that the active DHIS2 settings are up-to-date.

### STEP 2 : CLEAR CACHE & COOKIES IN THE WEB BROWSER

Just as you cleared the cache in the new MAD, you can also clear the cache of the web browser.

When working in the new MAD it is recommended to use either Microsoft Edge, Google

Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox.

When you use web browsers, they can save some information from websites in its cache and cookies. Clearing them fixes certain problems, like loading or formatting issues on sites.

MICROSOFT EDGE
```

Here are the steps for clearing cache and cookie in Microsoft Edge. Click on icon ( ), at the top right corner, then on _Settings_&#x20;

In Settings, select _Privacy, search and services_ , followed by _Choose what to clear_&#x20;

In the pop-up window click on _Clear now_ for pre-selected items, as in the screen shot below,

or tick next to the browsing history also.

You can get to the same pop up window by selecting _History_ on the menu icon:

Once you click on History, in the appear right corner you will have icon of a basket and if you

click on you will get the cache cleaning pop up window (as above).

### KEYBOARD SHORTCUT

In order to get to the cache cleaning pop window faster, you can use the keyboard combination _Ctrl + Shift + Delete_. First you will need to open the browser (new tab or the one you were at, it doesn’t matter) and click the following buttons on your keyboard at the same time: **Ctrl + Shift + Delete**

The pop window will appear immediately, and you will only need to click on _Clear now_&#x20;

Have in mind that after clearing history, cache, and cookies some settings on sites get deleted. For instance, if you were signed in, you’ll need to sign in again. Some sites can seem slower

because content (for ex. images), needs to load again.
