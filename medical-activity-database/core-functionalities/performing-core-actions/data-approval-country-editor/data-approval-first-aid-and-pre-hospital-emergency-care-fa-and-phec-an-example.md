# DATA APPROVAL First Aid & Pre-Hospital Emergency Care (FA\&PHEC) -an example

STEP 1:&#x20;

OPEN DASHBOARD APPLICATION There is a data approval process linked to aggregated data (monthly and quarterly reports/data sets) and a different data approval process linked to events data (trainings, ICRC visits, immunization campaigns and psychosocial activities). In both cases, data approval starts from the Dashboards in order to know what is pending approval. There are 2 dashboards dedicated to the status of reports used by country editors in order to see what needs to be approved: One refers to the aggregated data sets contained on the Data Entry application and is called “Approval status”. The other one refers to events and is called “FA\&PHEC Event approval”. Open the Dashboard application in a separate tab. You will get the following screen:

In the "Approval status" dashboard, there are 3 rows, one for each data set:

* FA Services,
* PHEC Services and
* FA\&PHEC Services. The selection of the data set depends on the activities each Organisation Unit is linked to. For instance, Ambulance Stations monitor only PHEC services, whereas an Emergency Response Team might monitor both FA\&PHEC. A table and a graph are provided. In order to know which report is pending approval you need to check the table.

The table indicates the number of reports to validate per Organisation Unit and time period, how many are draft, already approved or not started:

The graph gives an overview of the status of reports:

Click on the three-dot button to view the table in fullscreen mode.

From the example provided, as a Country Editor I know there is one report dated January 2022 to approve in FA Services data set. The Organisation Unit is Borno NRCS office.

Before approving data it is strongly recommended to open an additional DHIS2 tab in Chrome on the app “Data approval” This way you keep the two tabs open: Dashboard and Data approval.

STEP 2:&#x20;

OPEN DATA APPROVAL APPLICATION In order to ensure a better data quality, a data workflow is in place. Data entry implies a participatory process. Field users and country editors are both involved in the data entry & approval in regard to the activities that are being monitored. You are now ready to search the report to approve. In a separate tab, open the “Data approval cLASSIC” application

STEP 3: SELECT DATA SET AND ORGANISATION UNIT Select data set, the report period together with the Report Organisation Unit. Once selection is completed, click on “get data”.

For FA\&PHEC the monthly reports are approved at the level of the structure. So, you need to select the structure that is 1 level higher than the service delivery point.&#x20;

This can be suffixed by “FAPHEC” but it can also be a hospital, a health center or National Society Location, in which cases, it would be suffixed with ”HOS”, “HC” or “NSL”.&#x20;

It is at this level that you select the Organisation Unit in the Data Approval app and you approve the monthly reports.

STEP 4: APPROVE REPORT If data and information provided are reliable and ready to get approved, click on “Approve”.

STEP 5: UNAPPROVE REPORT

You may want to unapprove a report. Click on “Unapprove”.

In order to know the author of the report and take contact with, it is necessary to search the email address. Open a new tab and click on “Data Entry”.

\
Once in Data Entry, select the Organisation Unit, the data set as well as the period of the report that you unapproved. At the bottom of the report you find the name of the person who completed the report.

Note: When you apply changes, it may take a few hours to refresh and get the status report change in Dashboard.
