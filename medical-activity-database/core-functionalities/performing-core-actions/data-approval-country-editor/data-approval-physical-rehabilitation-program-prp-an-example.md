# DATA APPROVAL  Physical Rehabilitation  Program (PRP) -an example

#### DATA APPROVAL Physical Rehabilitation Program (PRP) - an example

The Data Entry application is used to manually enter routine data on PRP services and Societal integration as well as the yearly profile of the country and the Physical Rehabilitation Centers PRCs. The Country form and the PRC form are completed on a yearly basis at the level of the country and PRC respectively. The PRC monthly report and the ad-hoc support form are completed at the lowest service delivery point level PRP, right under the PRC. Monthly PRP indicators that do not belong to any PRC are monitored through the Extra-PRC Activities form at country or district level. The societal integration form is completed at country level on a quarterly basis. Concrete examples are provided in the following steps of this module.

STEP 1

OPEN DASHBOARD APPLICATION

Data approval starts from the Dashboards in order to know what is pending approval. There is 1 dashboard called “Approval status/PRP” dedicated to the status of reports. It can be used by country editors in order to see what needs to be approved. Open the Dashboard application in a separate tab. You will get the following screen:

In the "Approval status / PRP" dashboard, there is 1 row per data set that is subject to approval. For Monthly Reports, the selection of the data set depends on the existence of dormitory in the PRC AND the use of DCMS by the PRC. One data set only will be relevant for each PRC PRP PRC Monthly report PRP PRC Monthly report with dormitory PRP PRC Monthly report from DCMS PRP PRC Monthly

report with dormitory from DCMS. A table and a graph are provided. In order to know which report is pending approval you need to check the table.

A table and a graph are provided.&#x20;

In order to know which report is pending approval you need to check the table

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The table indicates the number of reports to validate per Organisation Unit and time period: how many are “draft”, “to validate” and already “approved”</p></figcaption></figure>

The graph gives an overview of the status of reports

Click on the three-dot button to view the table in fullscreen mode

From the example provided, as a Country Editor I know there is one report dated January 2022 to approve in the data set PRC Monthly report with dormitory. The Organisation Unit is Barishal center.

Before approving data, it is strongly recommended to open an additional DHIS2 tab in Chrome on the app “Data approval” This way you keep the two tabs open: Dashboard and Data approval



STEP 2: OPEN DATA APPROVAL APPLICATION

In order to ensure a better data quality, a data workflow is in place. Data entry implies a participatory process. Field users and country editors are both involved in the data entry & approval in regard to the activities that are being monitored. You are now ready to search the report to approve. In a separate tab, open the “Data approval” application
