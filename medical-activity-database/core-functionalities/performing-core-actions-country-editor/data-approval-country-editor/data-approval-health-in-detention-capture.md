# DATA APPROVAL Health in Detention -Capture

## DATA APPROVAL Health in Detention -Capture

The Capture application is used to enter data on different health programs . For instance, during one month several trainings, meeting and visits can take place. Each of them will be recorded in the Capture app as an individual event.

Please note that the examples used refer to HID, but the same process applies to all Health programs.

They all follow the same logic per program.

Here is a summary of all data sets/forms relevant to HiD:&#x20;

Dataset/Event name Org Unit level&#x20;

DET - M1 - Monitoring access to health care Service Delivery Point - \[HID]&#x20;

DET - S8 - Capacity building support Country level&#x20;

DET - S6 - Health System Strengthening Country level&#x20;

DET - S7 - Strengthening medical ethics Country level Service Delivery Point - \[HID]

The purpose is to find a report with details about events, according to the two statuses:

Approved Pending approval. You will get directed to a page where you find a table and a graph for each type of event. In order to know which report is pending approval you need to check the table. As showcased in the example here below, the table provides an overview of number of training events approved by Country Editor along with the number of events that are still pending approval.

In the example here below, the graph showcases the number of events approved by Country Editor along with the number of events that are still pending for approval, by month in 202 4. By clicking on the three-dotted square icon on the top-right corner, you can modify the period, series of data and make other selections to display data in the format relevant to you.

### STEP 2: SELECT PROGRAM AND ORGANISATION UNIT&#x20;

Open the Capture app. In the drop-down list on the left, select the program of your interest (1) together with the organization unit. Concerning the latter, you have two possibilities: either you search and select it (2) or, at the bottom, you get the list of all events accessible to you basing on the program and country you belong to. If you decide to see all events (3), you get a summary table of registered events.

The default view shows events that are pending approval. If you wish to filter for events that have been approved by Country Editor, click “Event approved by Country Editor”, tick “Yes” in the pop-up menu that opens and click “Update”.

To approve an event, simply click on the line showing the event of your interest, and that event will be opened for you to inspect and approve.

In case the event needs to be corrected by the Field User, the name of the person entering the data is recorded in the “Please enter your name” section. You are invited to coordinate with him/her for eventual corrections before approving it.

### STEP 4: APPROVE EVENT&#x20;

The section Data approval is only visible to Country Editors. As a Country Editor you can click on “Yes” to the question “Event approved by Country Editor”. Once finished, click on “Save” at the bottom of the page. The event is now approved and the status will be updated in the Events Approval Dashboard subsequently.
