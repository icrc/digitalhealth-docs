# Data Entry - First Aid & Pre-Hospital Emergency care

**INTRODUCTION**

The Data Entry application is used to manually enter routine data on FA\&PHEC services, which have been recorded for one Organisation Unit on a monthly basis using a specific data set. The country form is completed on a yearly basis. Please note that FA\&PHEC trainings as well as meetings/visits are monitored through the [https://dhis2.uat.icrc.org/dhis/dhis-web-capture/index.html](https://dhis2.uat.icrc.org/dhis/dhis-web-capture/index.html)



Here is a summary of all data sets/forms relevant to FA\&PHEC

**Step 1: SELECT ORGANIZATION UNIT (OU)**

Find the name of the Organisation Unit that you would like to enter data for on the drop-down tree menu. Lower levels will be displayed when you click on the "+" sign next to each Organisation Unit.

Click on your Organisation Unit on the menu to highlight it orange. This will enter the 'Organisation Unit' in the respective field of your data entry form.

FA\&PHEC country form is available at country level. FA\&PHEC services data sets are available at the lowest organization unit level that ends with FA\&PHEC.

Another quick way to find an Organisation Unit is to use the search box next to the green symbol with the lens above the tree menu. Type in the name or first few letters of your Organisation Unit, and select it from the drop-down menu by clicking on it to highlight it orange. This will enter the unit in the Organisation Unit field of your data entry form.

**Step 3: SELECT TIME PERIOD**

Select a period for which to register data. The available periods are determined by the reporting frequency required for the selected form. The data set you select will display all relevant indicators.

Note: Not all data sets are available for all Organisation Units. Make sure to enter data for the right Organisation Unit and the right period of time. If data has already been submitted for the period that you have selected, it will appear automatically in the form. You can also toggle between years, moving a year forward or backward using the 'Prev year' and 'Next year' buttons next to the period entry field.

The cells will turn green when the data has been automatically saved in the system. The cells will turn red when mandatory fields (identified with a star "\*") have not been filled. Grey fields are those that are completed automatically by the DHIS2 system. In case an invalid value or a value outside an acceptable range is entered, a pop-up window will detail the problem.Click on the cell(s) and correct the data. The cell(s) will turn green once you have entered the correct value

Note: Your browser may sometimes suggest values that are not built into the DHIS2 forms but have been stored in your browser cache from other websites. You can remove these values using the 'Browser Cache Cleaner' on the applications menu.



**Step 5: VALIDATE YOUR DATA**

Before validating your data, make sure you have entered data in ALL TABS in the form. It is important to run a validation check to make sure your data is logical and valid, based on rules built into each form. This step ensures that the data you have entered is accurate. A 'Run validation' button is available in each tab. Click 'Run validation' once completed the LAST tab in order to check your data

If all your data is accurate, you will receive a message telling you that the data has passed the validation test once it is complete. If some of the values in your form are inaccurate, you will get a different message telling you that there are errors in your data. It also tells you which values are invalid and which rule needs to be met (e.g. correct data range) for your data to be valid.

**Step 6: CORRECT YOUR DATA**

You should correct your data if the validation test detected errors on your form. Click on the cells that have invalid data (shown on the validation test message), remove the incorrect value and retype or reselect the correct value. The new value should meet the requirements of the validation rule shown on the validation test message.

**Step 7: SAVE AND SUBMIT YOUR FORM**

When you have finished entering and correcting the data on your form, click 'complete' to submit the data to DHIS2. It is important to remember to submit your data every time you fill out a new form. If you forget to click 'complete', the data is stored automatically in the system but the data may not always be included in some reports (this depends on how the forms are configured). This will impact the quality of the data on DHIS2. Be careful about clicking 'complete' because once you have submitted your data, you will not be able to edit it unless you have editing rights.
