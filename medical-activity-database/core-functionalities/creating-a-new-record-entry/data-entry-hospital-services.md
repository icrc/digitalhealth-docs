Health Unit – Data & Analytics



### INTRODUCTION

The Data Entry application is used to manually enter routine data on Hospitals Services\*\*.\*\*

The MAD HOSP is organized according to the Hospital Classification as per the type of the ICRC’s engagement in each hospital.

The table here below provides a description of the five types of hospitals according to the degree of ICRC engagement and support. It is updated to July 2022.

Type I to Type III: The ICRC staff presence involves a monitoring of the activities with the full set of indicators to be reported per supported departments.

Type IV: The set of indicators is softened due to less engagement in terms of patient care.

Type V: Only the kind of ad-hoc measures provided must be listed. Four additional indicators are implemented when available on the field.

Concerning the data sets that are relevant to Hospital Services, the table here below provides a list of them and, for each one, the role responsible for entering data, the organizational unit level and the periodicity.

### STEP 1: SELECT ORGANISATION UNIT (OU)

There are two possible ways to find and select your Organisation Unit:

1. Find the name of the Organisation Unit that you would like to enter data for on the drop-down tree menu. Lower levels will be displayed when you click on the "+" sign next to each Organisation Unit, which turns "-" once clicked. Concerning HOSP, let’s find and select Sa Ada Al Talh Rural Hospital - \[HSP] for types I to III. Click on your Organisation Unit on the menu to highlight it orange. This will enter the 'Organisation Unit' in the respective field of your data entry form.

2. Another quick way to find an Organisation Unit is to use the search box next to the green symbol with the lens above the tree menu. Type in the name or first few letters of your Organisation Unit and select it from the drop-down menu by clicking on it to highlight it orange. This will enter the unit in the Organisation Unit field of your data entry form.

### STEP 2: SELECT DATA SET, TIME PERIOD AND RELEVANT GO

In this step, select your data set, the time period and the GO code relevant to your activity. You can also toggle between years, moving a year forward or backward using the 'Prev year' and 'Next year' buttons next to the period entry field.

### STEP 3: ENTER DATA IN THE FORM

Start entering data by clicking inside the white cells and typing values in manually. Click on check boxes if any.

```
Most indicators showcase an
explanation of their function. If
you click on an indicator, a pop-
up window displays its
description.
```

The cells will turn green when the data has been automatically saved in the system.

The cells will turn red when mandatory fields (identified with a star "\*") have not been filled.

Grey fields are those that are completed automatically by the DHIS2 system.

In case an invalid value or a value outside an acceptable range is entered, a pop-up window will detail the problem.

Click on the cell(s) and correct the data. The cell(s) will turn green once you have entered the correct value.

_Note: Your browser may sometimes suggest values that are not built into the DHIS2 forms but have been stored in your browser cache from other websites. You can remove these values using the 'Browser Cache Cleaner' on the applications menu. If the problem persists, the following link guides you on how to disable or clear the AutoFill/AutoComplete in your web browser:_ [How Do I Disable or Clear AutoFill/AutoComplete Information? – iClassPro Support](https://support.iclasspro.com/hc/en-us/articles/218569268-How-Do-I-Disable-or-Clear-AutoFill-AutoComplete-Information-)



### STEP 4: VALIDATE DATA

A 'Run validation' button is available in each tab. It applies to the entire form not just to the screen that is open. Click 'Run validation' once completed ALL tabs contained in the data set.

“Run validation” checks for completeness of mandatory fields first and for other rules as a second step. It is important to run a validation check to make sure your data is logical and valid, based on rules built into each form. This step ensures that the data you have entered is accurate.

```
If all data is accurate, a validation result
message will be displayed.
If some of the values in the form are
inaccurate, a different message will alert you
about errors in the data, by identifying values
that are invalid and rules that need to be met
(e.g. correct data range) to finally validate
data.
```



### STEP 5: CORRECT DATA

If the validation test detects errors on the form, a validation result message details the kind of integrations and/or corrections to be applied (e.g. mandatory fields to fill, validation rules to apply).

Click on the cells that have invalid data, remove the incorrect value and retype or reselect the correct value. The new value should meet the requirements of the validation rule shown on the validation test message.

### STEP 6: SUBMIT DATA FOR APPROVAL

Once all fields filled and data verified, don’t forget to complete the form! By clicking on the “complete” button, you are confirming that the data has been entered and verified by yourself as Field User.

Once completed, a form is considered as submitted to the Country Editor for validation. The Country Editor will perform the final verification and proceed with the data approval.

However, in case some corrections need to be made after completing the form, click on “incomplete” and make corrections. Then, click on “complete” again so that the Country Editor knows that it is ready for approval.
