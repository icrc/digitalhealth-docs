# Data Entry -Physical Rehabilitation Program (PRP)

**INTRODUCTION**

The Data Entry application is used to manually enter routine data on PRP services and Societal integration as well as the yearly profile of the country and the Physical Rehabilitation Centers (PRCs). The Country form and the PRC form are completed on a yearly basis at the level of the country and PRC respectively. The PRC monthly report and the ad-hoc support form are completed at the lowest service delivery point level \[PRP], right under the PRC. Monthly PRP indicators that do not belong to any PRC are monitored through the Extra-PRC Activities form at country or district level. The societal integration form is completed at country level on a quarterly basis. Concrete examples are provided in the following steps of this module.

Here is a summary of all data sets/forms relevant to FA\&PHEC

**Step 1: SELECT YOUR ORGANIZATION UNIT (OU)**

Except for data sets that are available at country level (Country form, Extra-PRC activities and Societal Integration) for all other data sets (PRC form and monthly reports) you will need to find and select your Organisation Unit in two ways:

1. Find the name of the Organisation Unit that you would like to enter data for on the drop-down tree menu. Lower levels will be displayed when you click on the "+" sign next to each Organisation Unit. Click on your Organisation Unit on the menu to highlight it orange. This will enter the 'Organisation Unit' in the respective field of your data entry form.

Another quick way to find an Organisation Unit is to use the search box next to the green symbol with the lens above the tree menu. Type in the name or first few letters of your Organisation Unit and select it from the drop-down menu by clicking on it to highlight it orange. This will enter the unit in the Organisation Unit field of your data entry form.

**Step 2: SELECT YOUR DATA FORM, TIME PERIOD AND RELEVANT GO**

The country form is completed on a yearly basis at the level of the country. GO code selection is required.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (24) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The PRC form is completed on a yearly basis at the level of the PRC. GO code selection is required.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The PRC monthly report is completed at the lowest service delivery point level ending with \[PRP]. Depending on your PRC, the PRC monthly report could be with and without dormitory. GO code selection is required.

There are four kinds of monthly reports depending on whether the PRC has a dormitory or not and whether the PRC uses DCMS.

1. PRP – PRC Monthly report from DCMS
2. PRP – PRC Monthly report with dormitory from DCMS
3. PRP – PRC Monthly report
4. PRP – PRC Monthly report with dormitory For each PRC there is one data set which is assigned automatically when the PRC is configurated by the MAD support team.

The ad-hoc support form is completed on a monthly basis at the lowest service delivery point level \[PRP]. GO code selection is required.

Monthly PRP indicators that do not belong to any PRC are monitored through the Extra-PRC Activities form at country level at monthly level. GO code selection is required.

**Step 3: ENTER DATA IN THE FORM**

Start entering data by clicking inside the first cell and selecting data from the dropdown menus (if any) or typing values in manually.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (30) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click on check boxes.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (31) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Note: Your browser may sometimes suggest values that are not built into the DHIS2 forms but have been stored in your browser cache from other websites. You can remove these values using the 'Browser Cache Cleaner' on the applications menu.&#x20;

The cells will turn green when the data has been automatically saved in the system. The cells will turn red when mandatory fields (identified with a star "\*") have not been filled. Grey fields are those that are completed automatically by the DHIS2 system. In case an invalid value or a value outside an acceptable range is entered, a pop-up window will detail the problem. Click on the cell(s) and correct the data. The cell(s) will turn green once you have entered the correct value.



**Step 4: VALIDATE YOUR DATA**

A 'Run validation' button is available in each tab. It applies to the entire form not just the screen that is open. Click 'Run validation' once completed ALL tabs in order to check your data.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (32) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

“Run validation” checks for completeness of mandatory fields first and for other rules as a second step. It is important to run a validation check to make sure your data is logical and valid, based on rules built into each form. This step ensures that the data you have entered is accurate.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (33) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If all your data is accurate, you will receive a message telling you that the data has passed the validation test once it is complete. If some of the values in your form are inaccurate, you will get a different message telling you that there are errors in your data. It also tells you which values are invalid and which rule needs to be met (e.g. correct data range) for your data to be valid.

**Step 5: CORRECT YOUR DATA**

You should correct your data if the validation test detected errors on your form. Click on the cells that have invalid data (shown on the validation test message), remove the incorrect value and retype or reselect the correct value. The new value should meet the requirements of the validation rule shown on the validation test message.

**Step 6: SAVE AND SUBMIT YOUR DATA**

When you have finished filling in the form and verified the data, don’t forget to complete it. By clicking on the “complete” button, you are confirming that the data has been entered and verified by you as Field User.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once completed, a form is considered as submitted for validation to be further checked by the Country Editor. The Country Editor will do the final verification and will approve data. If, after completing the form you realize some corrections need to be made, click first on “incomplete” and make corrections. Then, click on “complete” button again so that the Country Editor knows that it is ready for approval.



**Step 7: HOW TO IMPORT DATA**

The purpose of importing data into the MAD from an excel file, originates from the need to work offline. This would help overcoming potential issues linked to the internet connectivity. Furthermore, you may want to share the report with your interlocutors/partners for offline data entry before importing/uploading it in the MAD. The Health data support team provides you with the excel file to enter data that contains the GO code(s) relevant to your delegation. Open the file, select the time period and start entering data in all columns.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Please note that the file contains many columns, so be sure to enter all necessary data. The mandatory indicators are marked with an asterisk (\*). Once finished, save the file on your computer.

In order to start importing data, open the “Bulk Load” application.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You are now ready to import data. Drag & drop the file that you previously filled and saved (1). Normally the Data Set you selected, the creation date and the number of data values entered will appear. You can now select the concerned Organisation Unit (2). Click on “Select import Organisation Unit”, find and select it. You can also apply the option “Search by name”. Type in the name or first few letters of your Organisation Unit, and select it from the drop-down menu. Click on “Import Data” (3).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once the uploading completed, a message will confirm if the data import was successful or not. The Data Set for which you are importing data, may already be partially filled in DHIS2. In such a case the system provides you with two options: PROCEED: this option implies that all data values that already exist will get deleted and only the ones included in the spreadsheet will be saved. IMPORT ONLY NEW DATA VALUES: the option implies that only new data will be imported. Select the option convenient with you.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In “Data Entry” application you can now search the Data Set for which you imported data. Select your Organisation Unit, relevant Data Set, period and GO code. Your report will contain all imported data.
