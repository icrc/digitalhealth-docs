# Data Entry Health in Detention (HID)

## Data Entry Health in Detention (HID)

### INTRODUCTION

The Data Entry application is used to manually enter routine data on HiD activities

Concerning the data sets that are relevant to Health in Detention, the table here below provides a list of them and, for each one, the specific level at which they are found in DHIS2 Organisation Unit hierarchy and the periodicity for each of them.

### Step1 : SELECT ORGANISATION UNIT (OU)

There are two possible ways to find and select your Organisation Unit:

1. Find the name of the Organisation Unit that you would like to enter data for on the drop-down tree menu. Lower levels will be displayed when you click on the "+" sign next to each Organisation Unit, which turns "-" once clicked. Concerning HiD, let’s find and select Antwerp prison - \[HID]. Click on your Organisation Unit on the menu to highlight it orange. This will enter the 'Organisation Unit' in the respective field of your data entry form.

2. Another quick way to find an Organisation Unit is to use the search box next to the green symbol with the lens above the tree menu. Type in the name or first few letters of your Organisation Unit and select it from the drop-down menu by clicking on it to highlight it orange. This will enter the unit in the Organisation Unit field of your data entry form.

### STEP 2: SELECT DATA SET, TIME PERIOD AND RELEVANT GO

In this step, select your data set, the time period and the GO code relevant to your activity. You can also toggle between years, moving a year forward or backward using the 'Prev year' and 'Next year' buttons next to the period entry field.

### STEP 3: ENTER DATA IN THE FORM

Start entering data by clicking inside the white cells and typing values in manually. Click on check boxes if any.

Most indicators showcase an explanation of their function. If you click on an indicator, a popup window displays its description.

The cells will turn green when the data has been automatically saved in the system.

The cells will turn red when mandatory fields (identified with a star "\*") have not been filled.

Grey fields are those that are completed automatically by the DHIS2 system.

In case an invalid value or a value outside an acceptable range is entered, a pop-up window will detail the problem.

Click on the cell(s) and correct the data. The cell(s) will turn green once you have entered the correct value.

Note: Your browser may sometimes suggest values that are not built into the DHIS2 forms but have been stored in your browser cache from other websites. You can remove these values using the 'Browser Cache Cleaner' on the applications menu. If the problem persists, the following link guides you on how to disable or clear the AutoFill/AutoComplete in your web browser:[How Do I Disable or Clear AutoFill/AutoComplete Information? – iClassPro Support](https://support.iclasspro.com/hc/en-us/articles/218569268-How-Do-I-Disable-or-Clear-AutoFill-AutoComplete-Information)

### STEP 4: VALIDATE DATA

A 'Run validation' button is available in each tab. It applies to the entire form not just to the screen that is open. Click 'Run validation' once completed ALL tabs contained in the data set.

“Run validation” checks for completeness of mandatory fields first and for other rules as a second step. It is important to run a validation check to make sure your data is logical and valid, based on rules built into each form. This step ensures that the data you have entered is accurate.

```
If all data is accurate, a validation result
message will be displayed.
```

### STEP 5: CORRECT DATA

If the validation test detects errors on the form, a validation result message details the kind of integrations and/or corrections to be applied (e.g. mandatory fields to fill, validation rules to apply).

Click on the cells that have invalid data, remove the incorrect value and retype or reselect the correct value. The new value should meet the requirements of the validation rule shown on the validation test message.

### STEP 6: SUBMIT DATA FOR APPROVAL

Once all fields filled and data verified, don’t forget to complete the form! By clicking on the “complete” button, you are confirming that the data has been entered and verified by yourself as Field User.

```
Once completed, a
form is considered as
submitted to the
Country Editor for
validation. The Country
Editor will perform the
final verification and
proceed with the data approval.
```

However, in case some corrections need to be made after completing the form, click on “incomplete” and make corrections. Then, click on “complete” again so that the Country Editor knows that it is ready for approval.
