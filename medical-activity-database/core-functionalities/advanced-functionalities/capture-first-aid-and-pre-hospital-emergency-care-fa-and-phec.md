# Capture First Aid & Pre-Hospital Emergency Care (FA & PHEC)

Introduction

The Capture application is used to enter data on FA\&PHEC trainings or meetings/visits. For instance, during one month several trainings can take place. Each of them will be recorded in the Capture app as an individual event. Here is a summary of all data sets/forms relevant to FA\&PHEC.\

**Step 1: SELECT YOUR DATA FORM**

In the 'Program' section find the name of your program in the drop-down list of data collection forms. Programs may be filtered according to the Organisation Unit you refer to - not all programs/forms are available at every Organisation Unit. Click on your program to add it to your data collection form.

Note: At this point, you may see a 'Registered events' summary table. This table and its functionality will be discussed later in this tutorial.

**Step 2: SELECT YOUR ORGANIZATION UNIT**

Find the name of the Organisation Unit that you want to enter data for on the drop-down tree menu under 'Registering Organisation Unit'. You can click down to lower geographic levels on the menu by clicking on the arrows next to the Organisation Unit names. Click on your Organisation Unit name to add it to the field 'Selected registering unit' on the form

Note: At this point, you may see a message under Program saying 'Some programs are being filtered'. This indicates that not all programs/forms may be available for every Organisation Unit.

Another quick way to find an Organisation Unit is to use the search box above the dropdown tree menu. Start typing the Organisation Unit name where is says 'Search' and click on the Organisation Unit from the dropdown list to enter it into your form.

Depending on the form, DHIS2 may prompt you to select a date from a calendar that appears in a drop-down menu. Search for the date when your data was collected by scrolling through months and years on the calendar and clicking on the day of the month.

Complete your form by filling in the data from the drop-down menus or by manually adding in the values. Mandatory fields are indicated by a red star. You need to fill them in to be able to save and submit the form

Greyed-out entries are those calculated automatically by DHIS2 system. You do not need to enter anything in them. If you type in a value that is not valid or is outside the acceptable value range, you will get a warning message below the cell telling you what an error has been made. You need to correct these values before submitting your form.&#x20;

Note: DHIS2 may take some time to calculate the values. Please click 3 - 4 times outside the form to force DHIS2 to calculate these entries.



**Step 4: MARK FORM AS COMPLETE**

Once all your data has been entered on the form, check the box next to 'Complete event' in the 'Status' section of the form to mark that your data is ready to be submitted. Leave the box unchecked if you need to come back to fill in missing data, or if the data needs to be checked by another person before submission.
