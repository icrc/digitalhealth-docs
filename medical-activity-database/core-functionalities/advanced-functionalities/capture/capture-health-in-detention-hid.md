### STEP 1: SELECT YOUR DATA FORM

In the 'Program' section find the name of your program in the drop-down list of data collection forms. Programs may be filtered according to the Organisation Unit you refer to - not all programs/forms are available at every Organisation Unit. Click on your program to add it to your data collection form.

_Note: At this point, you may see a 'Registered events' summary table. This table and its functionality will be discussed later in this tutorial._

### STEP 2: SELECT YOUR ORGANISATION UNIT

Find the name of the Organisation Unit that you want to enter data for on the drop-down tree menu under 'Registering Organisation Unit'. You can click down to lower geographic levels on the menu by clicking on the arrows next to the Organisation Unit names. Click on your Organisation Unit name to add it to the field 'Selected registering unit' on the form.

_Note: At this point, you may see a message under Program saying 'Some programs are being filtered'. This indicates that not all programs/forms may be available for every Organisation Unit._

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Another quick way to find an Organisation Unit is to use the search box above the drop-down tree menu. Start typing the Organisation Unit name where it says “Search” and click on the Organisation Unit from the drop-down list to enter it into your form.

### STEP 3: ENTER DATA IN A NEW FORM

To open a form and start entering your data, click on ‘Program’ and then on 'New'.

Depending on the form, DHIS2 may prompt you to select a date from a calendar that appears in a drop-down menu. Search for the date when your data was collected by scrolling through months and years on the calendar and clicking on the day of the month.

Complete your form by filling in the data from the drop-down menus or by manually adding in the values. Mandatory fields are indicated by a red star. You need to fill them in to be able to save and submit the form.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Greyed-out entries are those calculated automatically by DHIS2 system. You do not need to enter anything in them.

If you type in a value that is not valid or is outside the acceptable value range, you will get a warning message below the cell telling you that an error has been made. You need to correct these values before submitting your form.

_Note: DHIS2 may take some time to calculate the values. Please click 3 - 4 times outside the form to force DHIS2 to calculate these entries._

### STEP 4: MARK FORM AS COMPLETE

Once all your data has been entered in the form, check the box next to 'Complete event' in the 'Status' section of the form to mark that your data is ready to be submitted. All reports under the status “complete” are by default approved by the Country Editor who therefore does not need to approve them in another application.

Leave the box unchecked if you need to come back to fill in missing data, or if the data needs to be checked by another person before submission.

### STEP 5: SAVE AND SUBMIT FORM

```
If you are satisfied that your data form is complete or if you need to leave to find missing data, you
can save your progress and exit. Click on 'Save and exit' and DHIS2 will take you back to the summary
table.
```

```
Alternatively, if you want to submit the data and continue filling more data form for the same location
and form, click 'Save and add another' from the drop-down menu.
```

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Both options save the current form to DHIS2, whether it has been completed or not. When you return to the summary table, you will see that the data you have just submitted has been added to the table as a new row.

### STEP 6: VIEW AND FORMAT SUMMARY TABLE

{% hint style="info" %}
You can select which data columns you want to see on the table by clicking on the cog icon (1)
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

and selecting data columns from the list (2). By clicking on the cog icon you can also rearrange the order of the columns by clicking on the dial pad icon next to the data category that you would like to move (3), and dragging it to its new position among the other categories.

```
Remember to click 'Save' if you have made any changes to your summary table that you would like to
keep.
```

A table should appear showing a summary of the results that have previously been entered into DHIS2 for the specific form that you have selected.

You may have several registered events. You can sort the information according to columns in your table by clicking on the column names. This will rearrange the data from the highest to lowest values or vice versa, or alphabetically or vice versa.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The green arrow on the column name shows you the order of the sorted data in the column.

You can add or remove columns to the table by clicking on the cog icon and selecting/de-selecting data columns from the list.

### STEP 7: FINAL REPORT

The final “Registered events” report is now ready and showcases all columns and their components you selected in previous steps.
