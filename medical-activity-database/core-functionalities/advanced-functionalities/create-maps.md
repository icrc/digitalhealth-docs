# Create Maps

## MAPS

A table can be opened as Map. There are two ways to obtain a map:

### **View** as Map from Dashboards

### **Open** as a Map from the Data Visualizer app

Let’s start from opening the report that you previously saved under the name \[FA] Structures 2022. Click on the top-left corner to open the section with formats.

Click on “Open as Map”.

The table you created before contained 4 data items, but only one will be displayed in a map. You will need to select the one you need.

Let’s select “Permanent First Aid Posts supported”. Click then on “Proceed”.

You will get the following map. It showcases all first aid posts by geographic areas. On the left side a data breakdown into five categories is provided. The intensity of the colors highlights a minor or a major concentration of posts.

It is possible to add a layer for a further analysis purpose. Click on “Add layer” on the top-left corner.
{% endhint %}

Several options are available. Let’s select the layer “Thematic”.

As shown in the images here below, you are now asked to apply several selections in terms of data

In terms of org units

{% hint style="info" %}
It may be necessary to narrow down the view and analysis at country level. On that purpose, let’s focus on a specific country and select Lebanon (left side image here below), along with the Facility level (right side of the image). Once all selections completed, click on “Add layer”.
{% endhint %}

### You will get the following new map showing all

ambulance posts in Lebanon.

Your map can be saved (Click on “File” on the top bar and save it) and downloaded on your computer (Click on “Download” on the top bar).

The dashboard app contains many other features allowing you to create tailor-made formats. In case of need, we suggest you address your query to the Service Desk where the Health Data team will promptly assist you.
