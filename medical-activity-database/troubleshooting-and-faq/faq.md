### **FINDING REPORTS**

1.My report has been approved, so I can no longer edit it, but there is an error in data. How can I correct it?&#x20;

**Answer**: _Please write to servicedesk@icrc.org with the corresponding MAD name in the subject (i.e MAD Hosp, MAD PHC, etc)._

_DB mangers can refuse Approved reports and their status will change back to To Validate with the red mark. If they refuse it from To validate status, it will become a Draft with the red mark._

_Reports in To validate status can be edited by Country Editors. Reports in Draft can be edited by Field Users._

_Once the correction has been made, the report can be sent for validation again and approved, there is no limit on how many times a report can be refused and approved._

2.I lost the report I was working on. How can I find it?&#x20;

**Answer**_: Refresh the page (by clicking F5 on your keyboard) and click on "Monthly Reports" (1) clear all filters (2). Then, put unique data in the filter fields (3) to find the report you need. (i.e. month, structure, status â€“ filters can vary according to the MAD, here below view from MAD PRP ) and hit Apply (4)._

_The other option is to click on your Draft reports listed in the My job / My Tasks section, located on the right-hand side of the screen. This should take you to the Monthly Reports section and apply the Draft status filter._

_If unsuccessful, please write to servicedesk@icrc.org with the corresponding MAD name in the subject (i.e. MAD Hosp, MAD PHC etc)_

_DB managers will try to find the report. But please, be aware that if the report was deleted, on purpose or by mistake, it cannot be restored._

_If you start filling in a page with data in the Monthly report, but then leave your desk and the MAD web page stays idle for prolonged period of time, all unsaved work will be lost. Make sure to save your work every time, especially if you are leaving your work station/computer even for a short period of time. So, make sure you hit SAVE regularly in the top right corner of your monthly report._

3.\[MAD HOSP & DET] I cannot see the reports I was working on before going for R\&R / GVA / training in another country. What should I do?

**Answer:** _It often happens that a temporary replacement is given access to the MAD and the structure form, while the colleague being replaced is removed from the form. Make sure your Country Editor adds you back to the relevant structure. To do so, the Country Editor needs to open the structure you are reporting for, click on Edit in the top-right corner and remove / add the Field User._

### **INDICATORS**

4.here can I find a definition of indicators? How do I fill in the Country form or a form for a specific hospital / PRC, etc.?&#x20;

**Answer**: _Please use the Read Me function (in the top right corner): just click on it and you will get more information about the indicators in the pop up window._

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (86).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_Also, please look for Indicators definitions in the Reference document that can be found on the homepage of each MAD as well as on the dedicated Health Wiki MAD page._

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (67).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

5.The indicator field is greyed out, I can't fill in my data. What do I do?&#x20;

**Answer**: _Please check the definition of the indicator. Some indicators are automatically calculated fields that can't be populated manually such as totals, rates or percentages._

_Some indicators are connected to the particular service provided: if in the form the service is marked as unavailable, the indicators will be greyed out (see example below). So if the service/information is available, first change it to Yes, then you will be able to input the breakdown._

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (68).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_In case your issue is different, do not hesitate write to servicedesk@icrc.org with the corresponding MAD name in the subject (i.e MAD Hosp, MAD PRP, etc) if you need more information or clarification related to the indicators._

6.How can I get the list of indicators on an Excel sheet so I can share it with the PRC / stakeholders / interlocutors, etc.?&#x20;

**Answer:** _Open one of the Monthly Reports, then simply click on the dropdown arrow next to EDIT button and Export the Excel file or the Template. Look for the exported Monthly Report Excel file under Last Exports/Overview._

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (69).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_Please refer to the MAD video tutorials on the Health Wiki pages. There, you will find an elaborate explanation on how to export the data or just the indicators to an excel sheet._

_You can also write to servicedesk@icrc.org with the corresponding MAD name in the subject (i.e. MAD HOSP, MAD PRP, etc.) to get assistance on how to export a file._

7.When I export a document, my MAD page goes grey. I tried clicking on various buttons, but the page is frozen. What should I do?

**Answer**: _In situations like these it is highly recommendable that you reload the page by hitting F5 on your keyboard, or clicking on the reload button in Internet Explorer._

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (70).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### **ACCESS**&#x20;

8\. I have access to a MAD, but I cannot create a report.&#x20;

**Answer:** _If you are a Country Editor, you cannot create MR/QR. Country Editors can approve and read the existing reports in Draft and Approved status, but cannot create NEW reports or modify them while in Draft. Country Editor access does not cover Field User access._

_Therefore, if you are Country Editor but want to be able to create Draft reports or modify reports that are in the Draft status, please send an email to to servicedesk@icrc.org with the corresponding MAD name in the subject (i.e. MAD Hosp, MAD PRP, etc)._

9\. I'm a Field User but cannot create MR/QR: when I start a new report I don't have the option to choose a Hospital/ Detention facility to report on.&#x20;

**Answer**: _On top of being given Field User access to the MAD Hosp or MAD Det by the MAD team, every Field User needs to be added to the corresponding Hospital and/or Detention Facility form in order to be able to report on them. This should be done by the Country Editor. To do so, the Country Editor must open the Structure the Field User is supporting, click on Edit and add the Field User._

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (72).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_If in doubt, please send an email to to servicedesk@icrc.org with the corresponding MAD name in the subject (i.e MAD Hosp, MAD PRP, etc) and the MAD support team will assist you._

10\. I open the MAD from Lotus Notes (because Internet connection is slow / because that's what I'm used to), rather than the web. Is that ok?&#x20;

**Answer:** _All MAD applications are web based now and Lotus Notes access to the MADs is outdated. Lotus Notes doesn't synchronize in real time with the servers and can cause discrepancies, show different statuses of the report, incomplete updates of the data on two PCs used in the same office_

_In case the Internet is bad and you need to work offline on the reports. Please Export a report when you have the Internet connection and update it offline. Then again import it back when the Internet connection is stable (Please note that for each MAD we prepared short videos available on the Health Wiki "How to create a Monthly (Quarterly) report" that also cover how to use export/import function and work offline on the report). Click on the following links to see videos on "How to create a Monthly/Quarterly report":_

11\. Five days ago, I had access to the MAD, and all of a sudden this week it is not working. What should I do?&#x20;

**Answer:** _Your access to the MAD is linked to your ICRC profile. So, if you change a delegation or any part of your ICRC profile changes, you will automatically disappear from the MAD access groups as your old profile ceased to exist and the new profile is not added automatically. For instance, when you change delegations, your delegation code will change and you will therefore be removed from the access group._

_Please write to servicedesk@icrc.org to request MAD access with the corresponding level of access you had before._

12\. \[MAD HOSP & DET] Users can access the MAD but Country Editors cannot add them to the Hospital/Detention Facility form. Their name doesn't appear in the dropdown list.

**Answer:** _Check the delegation the user is from and that the code is in his profile. Check the Country form, make sure you add the users' delegations on the country form and save it (cf Country form example from MAD Hosp):_

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (73).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_Go to Hospital/Detention facility form and try again to add the users, their names should be in the drop down list this time, if not write to servicedesk@icrc.org with the corresponding MAD in the subject. (cf Country form example from MAD DET below):_

### **GENERATING OVERVIEWS**&#x20;

13\. I cannot generate an overview in MAD PHC.&#x20;

**Answer:** _Make sure you select a period of one year or less, since all the targets are based on yearly projections, the overview can only be generated for the periods of one year or less in MAD PHC._

14\. No matter which criteria I select, the overview generated always gives the same results.

**Answer**: _Please use the "Reset" button, this will clear your previously set criteria and allow you to generate a new overview._&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (75).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

15\. I generated an overview but it is not showing in the Last exports/overview list.&#x20;

**Answer**: _Please click on the "Refresh list" button, and the last generated overview will show up at the top of the list indicating the date and time when it was generated_

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (76).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

16\. When I click on "Generate overview" my MAD page freezes on the "Please wait" screen. I tried clicking on various buttons, but the screen is greyed out.

**Answer**: _In situations like these it is highly recommendable that you reload the page by hitting F5 on your keyboard, or clicking on the reload button in Internet Explorer (see point 7 for illustrations). Should you need assistance with performing these steps, please write to servicedesk@icrc.org with the corresponding MAD name in the subject (i.e MAD HOSP, MAD PRP, etc.) to get assistance from the MAD Team._
