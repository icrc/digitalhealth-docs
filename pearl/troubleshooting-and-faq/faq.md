**What's the difference between Pearl EMR HCD and just Pearl?**

PEARL is just a name for the tool. It is essentially OPEN MRS, so you can use it interchangeably&#x20;

&#x20;PEARL on its own is OPEN MRS that houses HID (healthcare in detention), MHPSS and HOSP  and for OPEN MRS PRP we use DCMS&#x20;
