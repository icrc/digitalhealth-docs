There are 2 different scenarios to keep in mind.

* Scenario 1: No past visit and only 1 active visit:&#x20;

o This should allow you to edit the date&#x20;

o Here April 1st is the visit and should be changed to April 3

```
o April 3 is now displayed
```

* Scenario 2: Have a past visit and an active visit&#x20;

o You cannot edit the date of one or the other&#x20;

o You have to either, 1 merge the two visits or&#x20;

o Two, add a past visit and then merge that one visit with the one you just created&#x20;

o Here a past visit for March 4 is added and then saved&#x20;
