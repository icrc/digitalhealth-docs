## Registering & Searching for an HSU

In the Landing Page (Main Menu), you will see two icons that allow you to register a new Health Service User (HSU) or to search for an existing HSU. Click on those icons to access existing HSUs’ files or to register a new HSU, this will take you to the registration page that allows you to register “Identifiable HSU” or “Anonymous (Unknown) HSU” (see next section).

* What is an HSU? _Health Service User (HSU) is used to label users of the services offered by_ _health programs._

This will take you to the registration page that allows you to register
identifiable HSU or anonymous (unknown) HSU.
```

_Demographic Information_ For continuity of care, registration records of HSUs are accessible by users who have access to the facility regardless of their health program association. For example:

* MHPSS visited a ‘detention facility A’ and provided counseling to ‘HSU A’
* ‘HSU A’ is registered in Pearl o The record becomes available to all programs who have access to the’ detention facility A’
* Detention doctor visits ‘HSU A’ in ‘detention facility A’
* Detention doctor goes back to the office and searched for ‘HSU A’ o Doctor finds record of ‘HSU A’ and added information regarding his/her visit in the forms specific to health care in detention (HCD)

_HSU Name_ In cases where the name of the father is used as the last name (i.e. Ahmed, son of Mohammad). Enter the information as follows:

* Given = Ahmed
* Middle = leave blank (optional field)
* Family Name = Son of Mohammad

### Figure 12 Registration form – HSU name

_HSU Gender_ Gender is a mandatory field regardless of whether the HSU wishes to disclose his/her gender identity. For reporting purposes, we need to identify whether the patient is a male, female, other or unknown.

### Figure 13 Registration form - HSU gender

```
‘ Unknown ’ is used for when an HSU wishes to remain completely
anonymous or when the practitioner is not able to ask the
question to verify.
```

_Date of Birth_ Users can enter the exact date of birth of the HSU or an estimate:

* Exact DoB: Enter day, month and year
* Estimated DoB: see details below

### Figure 14 Registration form - HSU date of birth

If the estimated date of birth is used, users can enter:

* **Years:** Enter the estimated age of the HSU. I.e. 50 for someone who is 50 years old
* **Months:** Enter the age of the child in months if less than 1 year. Max number is 11. If a child is 12 months old, enter as 1 year old.

_NOTE: the number cannot be greater than 12_

* **Combination of estimated years + months:** 18 months can be entered as 1 year and 6 months old

_Legacy IDs_ If other identifiers are used for the HSU, for instance the ICRC Code, you can enter it in the fields. You will be able to use this information to search for an existing HSU later.

### Figure 15 Registration form - HSU legacy ID

_Address_ This is an optional field. We are working on getting these fields populated with coded values per country:

* Admin level 0: Country = list all countries
* Admin level 1: State/Province = list all the states/provinces from the country selected
* Admin level 2/3/4: City/Village = list all the city/village/district from the Admin1 selected

```
o The admin levels 2 – 3 will depend on the granularity of the admin levels provided to
us
```

### Figure 16 Registration form - HSU address

**Anonymous HSU**

If the HSU need to be registered anonymously or if the information cannot be verified, then thick the box ‘ _Unidentified patient’_ and select _‘Unknown’_ for the gender\_.\_
