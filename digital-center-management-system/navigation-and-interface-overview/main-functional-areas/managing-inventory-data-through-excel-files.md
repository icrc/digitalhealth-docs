Through theses files you will be able to update any data among your warehouse except the quantities which need to be done through an inventory adjustement as it will create new entries (the stock moves).

The min quantity is the trigger to create a draft order, the max is the one which will order and the

multiple means what it means ðŸ˜Š.

Let s take the example of the first line&#x20;

It means if the quantity of this product will reach 20 or under, letâ€™s say 19 a reordering rule will be triggered and then 12 unit will be ordered as 19 + (2x6) = 31 < 35 but 19 + (3x6) = 37 > 35 and 35 is our maximum quantity.
