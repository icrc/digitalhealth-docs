#### Editing the HSU visit summary

**Editing an encounter (one form)**

The possibility to edit a form depend if it was validated or not before saving it: If the form is saved without checking the box “Validated by”, it is still editable but does not impact the workflow process. It is in draft

Click on the icon next to the form you wish to edit

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Editing a visit**

1. Click ‘ _Edit date’_.
2. Select the relevant date and click ‘ _Confirm’_.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Two different scenarios are possible:

```
o you will be able to edit the date;
o in the example below, the 25 th October visit date needs to be changed to 18 th October;
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

```
o 18 August is now displayed.
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Scenario 2 – past visit plus an active visit: o you cannot edit the date of either visit;&#x20;

you have to: ▪ either merge the two visits ▪ or add another past visit and then merge it with the new visit you just created; o in the example below, a second past visit, for 4 March, is added and then saved;&#x20;

this visit now needs to be merged with the visit for which the date needs to be changed (i.e. 2 March);&#x20;

once the two visits have been merged it will be possible to click on _‘Edit date’_ to change the date of either visit. (Please note that start and end dates of the visit must be same.)

#### Workflow and states (see annex 1)

To complete an PRP HSU workflow, a certain number of forms need to be documented to allow the continuation of the process.

If the user is trying to use one of the essential forms at a wrong time in the workflow an error message will be shown and the save function will be disabled:

For example, if trying to document Assessment Outcome and Goal Setting when services are already started

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**For Service delivery,**

The following forms have to be filled in, validate and save. The forms in Bold are mandatory to support

### Generic Form Features

* Encounter Date and Validation

Forms have an “encounter date” – Date Automatically populated when opening forms and a “validated by” check box

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (53).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If the form is validated + saved, it is not editable anymore

If the form is saved without checking the validated by, it stays editable.

```
Exception to the “validated by rule”: Financing Decision ( Editing ):
```

* Financing Decision\* section **Editable** if NOT Approve for Services (even with Validated By fulfilled)
* Financing Decision\* section **Read-only** if Approve for Services (and with Validated By fulfilled)

**Exception to the “validated by rule”: Technical cards**

* Date below the validated \* stay **Editable** even after form validated and saved

```
```

* Date picker: Allow to document dates in a form but is not recorded as the encounter date (the day the form was done)

For example, on the technical cards:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (55).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Information and Visual guides: Used to support the user in making sure he/she is documenting the right thing.

For example, on the Wheelchair assessment:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (54).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Difference between radio button and check boxes

A radio button is used when you can select **only one option** in a list

For example, questions in the General Information, Initial Assessment

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (56).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* A check box is used to allow **a multiple-choice** selection (one or more)

For example, the Comorbidity and Past Medical History list in the Condition form, Initial Assessment.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (57).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **+ /-** sign inside a form to add same group of information more than once

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (58).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By clicking on the “+” you can add a line (or a group of line) and document it multiple time.

By clicking on the “-“ you can remove a line that you have added and you decide is not relevant.

* Auto populated field are fields automatically populated with information coming from another form or from an automatic calculation. These fields are pasted in grey color and cannot be changed.

Example, 1 , the field assessment outcome (summary) in the Final Assessment Outcome and Goal Setting contain the information from the last assessment done (initial or intermediate).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (59).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Example 2, the field “Follow-up date according to HSU Age is automatically documented with a calculation rule:

**• If the user age is under 6 years, then appointment date will be after 3 months**

**• If user age is from 6 years to 15 years, then the appointment date will be after 6 months**

**• If the user age is more than 15, then the appointment date will be after a year**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Mandatory fields are fields that need to be documented before the form can be saved. They are marked with a “\*”.

If the user is trying to save a form forgetting some fields, it will be impossible to save and an error message will be showing.

For example, in the stump assessment:
