## Editing the HSU visit summary

Two different scenarios are possible:

{% hint style="info" %}
o you will be able to edit the date;&#x20;

o in the example below, the 25 th October visit date needs to be changed to 18 th October;
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (37) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
```
18 August is now displayed.
```
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (38) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Scenario 2 – past visit plus an active visit: o you cannot edit the date of either visit;&#x20;

you have to: ▪ either merge the two visits ▪ or add another past visit and then merge it with the new visit you just created; o in the example below, a second past visit, for 4 March, is added and then saved;&#x20;

this visit now needs to be merged with the visit for which the date needs to be changed (i.e. 2 March);&#x20;

once the two visits have been merged it will be possible to click on _‘Edit date’_ to change the date of either visit. (Please note that start and end dates of the visit must be same.)
