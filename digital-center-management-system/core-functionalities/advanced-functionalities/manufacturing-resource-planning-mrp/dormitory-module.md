# Dormitory Module

For the one who knew Odoo V1, there is no more “Dormitory module”.

All the admission is done via the SU Module now.

## **First Configuration.**

### **Create Caregiver :**

On the SU form there is a Checkbox “Has a caregiver”, If this is checked a new Tabs will appear “Caregiver(s)”

In this tab you can see and create all the Caregiver for the patient.

We will need the Name and gender of this caregiver, You can put the relationship of this caregiver on the Field “Caregiver”. In this case “Wife”.

Based on the gender of the patient it will select a Ward in this case the Women Area as been selected.

If the User will have caregiver, on the second tab “SU Companion” you can add the caregiver.

You will be able to see only the caregiver created for this SU. Each Line here will need to be admitted separately since the date will maybe be different.

It can be possible as well to have the same caregiver multiple time with different dates like :
