### **Products & Creating a new one**

Product is typically what you have in mind when you are thinking of a product (for instance a bolt, plaster ...) but it can be some other type as well such as services (physiotherapy sessions, night spend in dormitory ...)

Let’s start with the creation of a product :

What are the product type available?

Storable means it is a physical product we will count in inventory such as wheelchair or bag of plaster of Paris for instance

Consumable product means it is a physical product but we will not count it in inventory. Therefore the product will be considered always as available.

For instance :

Plaster of Paris will be purchase per bag of 20 kilos but once the bag is in the workshop we will not count the plaster left in the bag. If we pick 2 kilos in the bag we will consider the plaster in the bag as always available.

In fact in the workshop there will be two products :

The bag of 20 kilos which will be a storable product which need to be replenish.

The consumable product Plaster of Paris which will be considered as always available in this one we will pick the Plaster needed for manufacturing.

Service product which are non physical product. It is the case for physiotherapy session for instance.

The product category has to be relevant to help the end user to quickly find the product he/she needs.

Internal Reference

It has to be unique, if it is not the following message will prompt&#x20;

It can be the reference of a provider but be aware to stay consistent.

“Allow negative stock” should never be checked In the DCMS.

“Unit of Measure” will be the UOM used when we need the product in the center.

Some more advance settings will be seen in the advanced inventory chapter.

Product Variants

Product can have variants, for instance a foot can have a side, a color, a size ...
