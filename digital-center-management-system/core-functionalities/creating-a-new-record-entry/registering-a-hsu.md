The centre using the PMS prior to the DCMS deployment
will see their essential PMS data migrated
(Demographic, past services, etc...) in order to keep the
memory of the previous digitalised data.
```

The PMS ID will be as well saved in the system in order for the receptionist to be able to retrieve the paper file. It can be used to search for an existing HSU later.
