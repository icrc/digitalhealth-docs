# Get the product to repair

To start the process, you first need to receive the product to be repaired. You have two options:

**Option 1: Using the SU**

1.
   * Go to an SU and click on the "Receive items to repair" button.
   * If you have already created a manufacturing order for this client, the system will automatically select the most recent one.
   * Validate the receipt.

**Option 2: Using the Repair Module**

* Navigate to "Repair" > "Receive for repair."

* This will create a receipt order. You need to select the correct partner and the correct product on the operations tab.
* When validating, the system will suggest the correct lot number. You can either accept this suggestion or manually select the correct lot number.
* Use the "Auto fill" and "Validate" options to complete the movement.

After completing these steps, you can proceed to the next step: creating the repair order.
