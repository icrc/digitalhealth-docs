# Repair process

To start the repair process in Odoo, click on "Start Repair". If an error pop-up appears, refer to \[[this guide](broken-reference)].

If the configuration is correct, all components in the list should be in the "Waiting Another Move" state, indicating that a transfer is in progress to replenish the repair stock.&#x20;

The next step involves the storekeeper, who needs to go to "Resupply Repair" in the Inventory module to validate the transfer once the user collects the components. This step follows the standard stock move process, which you can review in detail \[here].

Once the transfer is validated, returning to the Repair Order will show that all components are now in the "Available" state, with their reserved quantities updated.

When the repair is complete, simply click on "End Repair". The repair process is now finalized, and the stock has been updated accordingly in Odoo.
