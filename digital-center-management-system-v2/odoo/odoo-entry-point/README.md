## ðŸ§© What is Odoo?

**Odoo** is an open-source, modular Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform used by organizations to streamline and automate various business processes. Its strength lies in its flexibility â€” businesses can choose only the modules they need and customize them to fit unique workflows.

In most center contexts, **Odoo is used as a central tool to manage the full lifecycle of prosthetic devices** â€” from the moment a prescription is made to the final delivery of the prosthesis to the Service User. Beyond production, it also supports related operations such as stock tracking, dormitory management and even more.
