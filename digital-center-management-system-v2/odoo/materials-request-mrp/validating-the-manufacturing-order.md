# Validating the Manufacturing Order

To validate a Manufacturing Order (MO), click on the “Mark Done” button. Several checks are performed during validation:

1.  If any work order is still open, a pop-up will inform you to complete all work orders first.\

2.  If the consumed quantity differs, a pop-up will warn you. After reviewing, you can either “Confirm” or “Review the consumption” in more detail\

3.  If no serial number was assigned, a pop-up will prompt you to provide a Lot/serial number.\

To assign a Lot/serial number, return to the MO, create a new Lot manually or click the + button to add the serial number, and re-validate the record.

After resolving any issues, the MO status will change to “Done” and become read-only. The next step is to deliver the product to the SU.
