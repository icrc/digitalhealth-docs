There are multiple ways to progress this order:

1\.     Clicking on "AutoFill", then click on “Validate”.

It will AutoFill all the quantities available in the tabs “Detailed operations”

2\.     Directly clicking on "Validate"¨

If no “Done quantities” are recorded, a pop-up will ask if you want to process all the reserved quantities before validating. If you apply it will AutoFill all the quantities available.

3\.     Updating the quantity line by line.

Sometimes the reserved quantity is hidden. To show it, click on the three dots and select "Reserved quantity". This will display the quantity to be retrieved and the correct value to populate in the done column.

Once the quantities are correctly populated, click on "Validate". After validation, the system will ask if you want to create a backorder for any remaining products not yet delivered. If you want to deliver or pick up these components later, create a backorder. If you do not want to deliver the remaining products, select “No backorder”.

This step is mostly the same for Every stock move, only the Stock location / Destination change.
