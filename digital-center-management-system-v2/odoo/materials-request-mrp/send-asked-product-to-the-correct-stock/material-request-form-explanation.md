&#x20;If it's an internal transfer, you will see a checkbox "Is recasting" that indicates whether the picking component is used for recasting. This checkbox is purely informational and does not perform any actions. To know more about recasting go to this section “Ask for recasting”.

There are two main tabs in this form: "Detailed Operations" and "Operations".

The "Detailed Operations" tab shows the specific operations required for the stock move, including any reserved quantities and lot numbers if necessary.

The "Operations" tab shows the amount of product requested for the move. If the move is in draft status, only the "Operations" tab with the amount of product requested will be visible.
