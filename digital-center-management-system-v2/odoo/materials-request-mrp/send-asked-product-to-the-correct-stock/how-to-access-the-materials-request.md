# How to access the Materials request

There are two ways to access the Materials Request.

The first way is through the Inventory Menu:

1\.     Click on the correct **Picking Type** (by default, it is **Picking Component**, but this may vary depending on the center's configuration).

2\.     In the SU Form, you will find a tab called "Stock Pickings", where all stock movements created for this Service User (SU) are listed. In this case, we will open the one with the "Waiting" status.
