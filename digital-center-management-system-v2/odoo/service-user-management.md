# Service User Management

## **🧭** Context&#x20;

The **Service User Management** application in Odoo provides a central list of all patients who have been created in OpenMRS and for whom the _Initial Decision Form_ has been completed. This application acts as a reference point for managing patients within Odoo. Only essential information is synchronized from OpenMRS — such as the patient's name, age, gender, and address. No clinical or additional data is transferred, ensuring that only the basic identification details are maintained in Odoo.

## How to find a specific Service User (SU)&#x20;
