# ALMANACH User Guide

## Overview

In complex and under resourced settings, we face stark human resource shortages. There is often no trained doctor available to treat children in rural primary care facilities or the health workers who are available may not have the expertise to effectively manage pediatric cases according to evidence-based guidelines. Additionally, over-prescription of antibiotics is a major problem and some emergency presentations are not effectively referred and managed. All of these problems lead to beneficiaries receiving low quality of care and contribute to .&#x20;

&#x20;ALgorithms for the MANAgement of CHildhood illness (ALMANACH) is an offline Android application for primary care workers that guides them through a gold-standard pediatric consultation. It collects data gathered by the health worker throughout their clinical examination and history taking, and provides the health worker with a recommended diagnosis and treatment or management plan. <br>

ICRC has published many scientific articles on the effectiveness of ALMANACH in increasing care quality, increasing the use of prevention strategies (deworming, vitamin A and vaccines) and rationalizing antibiotic prescriptions. When compared to using a paper version of the same treatment protocols, outcomes for beneficiaries are more favourable at one week follow up.&#x20;

Users feel confident using the application, enjoy the features of the app, for example the drug dosage calculator, and they report that caretakers in the community are requesting the use of ALMANACH and are understanding that antibiotics are not necessary for all sick children.
