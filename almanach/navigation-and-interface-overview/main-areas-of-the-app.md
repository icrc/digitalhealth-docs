# Main areas of the app

There are three main areas in the CHT application,&#x20;

* The People section
* The Tasks section
* The Reports section&#x20;

### The People section&#x20;

The People section is the area that allows you to see the health facility information for the facility you are assigned to and also information about you as a user. This includes a summary of the consultations stored on the device (which will stay until you are able to sync and send them off for safe storage). &#x20;

**It is from the people section that you start a new consultation** and see a summery of main consultations.&#x20;

You can read the People section which is outlined in the [landing-page.md](landing-page.md "mention") section of the documentation.

### The tasks section

The tasks section shows paused consultations awaiting to be resumed by the healthcare worker. These are usually due to patients undergoing a test such as a malaria test, urine test or waiting for a second temperature measurement.&#x20;

You can resume the consultation by navigating to the **Tasks** tab either on the left or at the bottom of a smaller screen. The paused consultations will appear as a list and you will have been prompted to label the case to be able to re-identify the beneficiary after the pause.
