# Main areas of the app

There are three main areas in the CHT application,&#x20;

* The health facility section
* The tasks section
* The reports section&#x20;

### The health facility section&#x20;

The health facility section is the area that allows you to **start a new consultation** and see a summery of main consultations.&#x20;

You can read the health facility section which is outlined in the [main-interface.md](main-interface.md "mention") section of the documentation.

### The tasks section

The tasks section shows paused consultations awaiting to be resumed by the healthcare worker. These are usually due to patients undergoing a test such as a malaria test, urine test or waiting for a second temperature measurement.&#x20;

You can resume the consultation by navigating to the **Tasks** tab either on the left or at the bottom of a smaller screen. The paused consultations will appear as a list.
