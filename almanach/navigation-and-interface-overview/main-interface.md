# Main Interface

The main interface when you login as a user is the user facility that your user account is allocated to.&#x20;

You will see a summery about your facility as well as a list of latest consultation information categorized into last **3 months**, **6 months.**

And it's from the main interface you can start a new consultation as well as edit your user account settings and manage context parameters of your facility depending on your access level.&#x20;
