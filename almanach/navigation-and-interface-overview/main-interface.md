# Main Interface

The main interface when you login as a user is the health facility that your user account is allocated to. Make sure you are on the "People" tab in the black banner at the bottom of the page or if using on the web, on the left of the page.

You will see a summery about your facility as well as a list of latest consultation information categorized into last **3 months**, **6 months.**

And it's from here that you can start a new consultation as well as edit your user account settings and manage context parameters of your facility depending on your access level...
