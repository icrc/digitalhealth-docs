The main interface when you login as a user is the health facility that your user account is allocated to will be in the tasks tab. This is where you will see any incomplete consultations you may have started and paused for tests such as malaria tests or urine dipstick tests.

You will see a summery about your facility as well as a list of latest consultation information categorized into last **3 months**, **6 months.**
