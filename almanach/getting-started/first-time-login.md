# First Time Login



This document outlines the steps required to log in to the Community Health Toolkit (CHT)  application using your provided username and password.

### Prerequisites

* You must have a valid user profile If you do not have these credentials, please contact your administrator or support team.
* Access to the CHT application's login page.

### Login Steps

1. **Navigate to the Login Page:** Open your web browser or launch the CHT application. You will be directed to the login screen.
2. **Log in with SSO:** Click on the button near the bottom of the page that says "Sign in with SSO". This is "Single Sign On" - a secure way to log in, even if you are not connected to the internet.



### Post-Login Actions (CHT Application)

Upon successful login to the CHT application, you may be prompted to complete the following actions:

1. **Accept Terms of Use and Privacy Policy:** You will be presented with the application's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Please read through the information carefully and click "Accept" or "Agree" to proceed. Acceptance of these terms is mandatory for continued use of the application.
2. **Change Password (If Required):** For security reasons and in the unlikely event that you are not using SSO, you may be prompted to change your password to a stronger, more secure one. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new password. It is recommended to use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
3. **Optional training tutorial:** A box will appear with a tutorial, showing you how to use the application. Click through the tutorial using the next button to familiarise yourself with the app.

### Troubleshooting

* **Incorrect Credentials or forgot password:** If you are not using SSO and receive an "Invalid Username or Password" or "Forgot Password?" error, double-check your entries for typos, correct capitalization, and ensure you are using the most current credentials. If the issue persists, contact the support team via your ICRC focal point, or using this email address :&#x20;
* **Connectivity Issues:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

If you continue to experience issues logging in, please contact technical support with details of the problem and any error messages you received.
