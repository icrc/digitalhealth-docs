# Setting up Context Parameters

ALMANACH lite is a global algorithm that is adaptable to certain context-specific parameters:

* Malaria-endemic area
* High HIV prevalence area
* Availability of Rapid Diagnostic Tests for Malaria and which type
* Pulse Oximeter availability
* Whether the facility treats acute malnutrition

Before starting consultations, the context parameters should be set for a health facility. This includes some crucial information needed for the algorithm to function and provide decisions based on the input.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that it's important to setup the context parameters correctly before starting any consultations. Not providing the correct context parameters will lead to the algorithm providing incorrect outputs.
{% endhint %}

In the **Global Almanach** algorithm, there are several context parameters that has to be set. You can set the context parameters by:

1. &#x20;navigating to the health facility that you want to change the context parameters
2. click the menu icon button&#x20;
3. then click **Edit** from the drop-down menu.

From the context parameter page, you can also change the facility name as well as the primary contact point of the facility.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You may require additional user permissions to change the Context parameters. If you don't have access to change context parameters please contact your supervisor or reach for technical assistance.&#x20;
