# User Roles and Permissions

Your user-roles permissions are assigned by a supervisor. If you think your user-roles and permissions are not matching your daily role please contact support team to change your permissions.

### Changing user permissions

If you have administrative access to the CHT application, you can change the user roles for a given user.

**To change the user role or permissions**

* Navigate to the CHT application management page
* Navigate the the users page&#x20;
* Select the user you want to change their permission by clicking on the username
