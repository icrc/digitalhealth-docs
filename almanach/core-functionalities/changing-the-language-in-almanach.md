You can change the language of the data collection form and the user interface to your preferred language. The content of the app is available for now in French or English.

To change the language of the clinical content and the application user interface:

Open the "hamburger" (three horizontal lines) menu in the top left of the screen. You will see "user settings" with a person icon next to it.
