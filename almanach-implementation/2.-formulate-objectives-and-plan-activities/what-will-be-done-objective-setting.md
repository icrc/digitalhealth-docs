# What will be done: Objective Setting

Establish measurable objectives to guide implementation, covering service reach, user engagement, and outcome improvement. These objectives should align with ICRC’s health goals and local healthcare priorities and should be SMART:

·         Specific, i.e. distinct and precisely defined;

·         Measurable, i.e. include quantitative and/or qualitative elements that can be measured;

·         Achievable, i.e. realistically attainable, including in the time frame envisaged;

·         Relevant to identified needs and risks;

·         Time-bound, i.e. establish by when the objective is to be achieved or a clear before and after.

Add the relevant GOs and SOs to the objectives where possible.
