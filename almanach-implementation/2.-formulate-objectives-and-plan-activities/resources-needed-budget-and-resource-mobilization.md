# Resources needed: Budget and Resource Mobilization

All activities need resources to make them a reality. Develop a budget that provides allocations for initial expenditures but also costs for the implementation and maintenance phases.

Outline main budget items:

* Focal Point Funding: A dedicated manager can drive success by overseeing engagement and troubleshooting. This could be a partial or shared FTE based on need, try to identify cross-delegation opportunities for savings or centralizing a common function at HQ.
* Training and Support Costs: Account for initial and ongoing training, as well as user and technical support. Where possible try to make in-app tutorials that will reduce load on the deployment teams. Also design good documentation that can be read by our helpdesk GenAI chatbot to provide immediate answers to users and only escalate questions to the Belgrade team when needed.
* Infrastructure Costs: Budget for essential devices, connectivity, and any additional IT support required.
