# Define Scope and Context

* **Identify Target Populations**: Determine which populations will use or benefit from the solution. Consider their digital literacy, access to the internet, and how the existing workflow can integrate the tool.
* **Geographic Area and Facility Capacity**: Assess the need of beneficiaries in given geographic areas as well as the skills of health workers in the facilities in question, facility capacity, and connectivity. Determine needs for clinical support, lab services, referral pathways, and other resources or services as relevant.
* Health Needs: Define specific health problems or clinical domains the solution will address, considering prevalence and current limitations in addressing these needs.
* Service duration scope and Availability: It may be that the ICRC tool is being used to bridge a perceived short-term access problem or used until the health authority can implement an existing solution. It may be that the government would like to take over the implementation and hosting of the solution as part of their digital health transformation activities. In addition to the broader implementation duration, on a day-to-day basis, decide on any support service hours and maximum response times for obtaining user support.
