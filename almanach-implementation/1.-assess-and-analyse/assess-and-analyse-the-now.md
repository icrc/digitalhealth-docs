# Assess and analyse the now

Following the Results Based Management (RBM) framework, the first step is to understand the problem: What is happening, what is important and what can \[the solution] do to improve the now?

Once it is clear that \[the solution] can improve the problem, you can then look into how and where to deliver value through the deployment of \[the solution].
