# Exit Strategy and Long-term Planning

If a transition to local governance is planned, develop a handover process with the Ministry of Health or local authorities to ensure sustainability. This should be discussed at deployment and you may need to work with the MoH over months or years to ensure its success. Document all procedures and lessons learned to guide future deployments.
