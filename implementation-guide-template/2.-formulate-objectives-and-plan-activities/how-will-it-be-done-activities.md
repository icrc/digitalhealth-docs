# How will it be done: activities

1. Data Protection and Compliance: Confirm data security protocols and adapt the \[solution] terms of use and privacy policies if needed. ICRC provides \[solution] with systems in place for data privacy, access and protection of beneficiary information and confidentiality. ICRC is responsible for data within the \[solution], but if data is downloaded by a user from the Tool\[JE1] , that data is no longer under the remit of the ICRC data protection policies and processes.
2. Clinical Workflow Integration: Design a workflow that minimizes disruption and integrates smoothly with current procedures while maximizing adherence to national/international health standards to ensure the highest quality of care possible.
3. Preparation of facilities: Ensure the availability of supplies needed to fulfil the \[solution] functions, e.g., hardware and internet connectivity, supply of medicines and consumables if required.
4. Plan training sessions: Train users on use of the tool, and any other booster training needed to use the tool (e.g., clinical training). Train decision-makers to be able to find and analyse the data provided by \[solution] for their decision-making.
5. Support Structure: Set up IT and functional support structure, with defined roles for field IT and helpdesk support and issue resolution. If third parties are using \[the solution], consider that ICRC service desk tickets need to be raised by an ICRC staff.

&#x20;\[JE1]May want to standardize as some paragraphs have a lot of bracket mentions of \[solutions] and others don't.
