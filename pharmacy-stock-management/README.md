# Introduction

## Overview

The PSM project provides a web and mobile app-based tool (with off-line capability), real-time digital solution for stock and order management as well as detailed business analytics at and for assisted health care facilities. It is fully integrated with the ICRC ICT environment (IRIS and Tableau Business Analytics) and provides global, real-time stock and data visibility to all pharmacy staff as well as ICRC Health programme managers, logistics services and general management with access from any computer or mobile device connected to the ICRC network anywhere in the world.&#x20;

Staff at ICRC assisted health care facilities replaces data collection on paper or with spreadsheet applications by recording data directly on mobile devices on-line (with off-line capability) using a dedicated mobile device application specifically adapted to the Imprest System. And Health staff will no longer have to re-enter data provided by pharmacies into Excel files (or any other application) for calculating monthly replenishment orders.&#x20;

The current, paper- (or spreadsheet) based, workflow for replenishing pharmacies at assisted health care facilities is replaced by a fully digital, integrated and systematic workflow which is standardized across all assisted health care facilities in the ICRC using the Imprest System. Health program managers can manage and control Imprest Levels at the item level for each facility without any other users having access and being able to modify replenishment calculations.&#x20;

A dedicated IRIS Imprest Order management application will access pharmacy data as well as data from JDE (stock on order) for correctly calculating monthly orders based on the Imprest System and placing orders directly in IRIS (JDE front-end, user interface for the ICRC Logistics Information System) like any other order.&#x20;

Health and management staff at all levels will have access to all data from assisted health care facilities through the ICRC Business Analytics application (Tableau) and be able to visualize and analyse data of individual or across several health care facilities.&#x20;

For health care facilities using the “Advanced mode”, Health managers, logistics planners and management staff will have access to global, real-time stock and stock management data across all assisted health care facilities as well as a complete history of all data at the level of supplied wards and services within health care facilities.&#x20;

The PSM serves as a mobile data collection tool for recording (entering/changing/managing) logistics data (Imprest Level, Stock on Hand and Stock distributed) at ICRC assisted health care facilities. Data is stored on a DHIS2 server at the ICRC in Geneva and integrated with IRIS for calculating replenishment orders as well as with Tableau for business analytics..
