* If you don't have an access to TeleConnect yet, please refer to your Health Program Coordinator or TeleConnect focal person.
* When you are making an invitation, the other option, "Service user in person" is meant to allow you to call a colleague while a Service User is next to you, and you need some advice. Which is a different use case, but you can use it if you wish.
* In the scheduling form, select the language of your Service user or colleague, for them to receive the email or WhatsApp or SMS in their own language.
* If the Service user speaks a different language to you, it is strongly recommended to plan the session in advance to ensure that an interpreter is available.&#x20;
* To receive a call, you need to be already connected to a session. If you are not connected, you may receive an SMS notification. \
