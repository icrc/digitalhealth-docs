## 2.1. As a TeleExpertise requester

You may be a health worker in the periphery or in a district hospital and need support on a case from an expert medical practitioner. You may be seeking support while the Service User is in consultation with you, or after having carried out a clinical consultation with them. You may be requesting advice ahead of your next appointment. Either way, you are a teleExpertise "requester".

### **2.1.1. Request expert advice**

**Step 1: Connect to the dedicated TeleExpert request webpage**

Use [_this link_](https://teleconnect-request-expert.ext.icrc.org/) to connect to the page dedicated to requesting an expert's advice. Read and accept the terms of use text to be able to enter.

From that page, you can select your language and then click on "Institutional Connection" if you are ICRC staff, or follow the sign-in instructions if you are an external.

>
> If you don't have an access yet, please refer to your Health Program Coordinator.

You will land on the page below - that will be empty (as on the screenshot below) if you connect for the first time

From there, you will be able to select the type of expertise you need or the queue you would like your call to be placed in.

Then you will need to indicate the beneficiary information.

Once you've added all the relevant information, click on "Request session". The expert will have access to the information you indicated in the form, as well as anything you added in the chat before or during the session with him or her.

It will automatically open a "TeleExpertise" page.

If you wish to ask for advice in the chat, you can start typing or uploading PDFs or photos. Please note that he expert will not reply if they are not online.

If they don't answer, you can click on "Back to Dashboard".

#### **Step 3: Wait for expert advice**

A call session will start when an expert takes the call. You will need to accept the call by clicking "Accept". Alternatively, you can just communicate using the chat function.
