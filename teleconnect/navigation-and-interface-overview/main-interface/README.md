### 1. TELECONNECT SESSION (GENERAL USER GUIDE)

As mentioned, TeleConnect can be used for any confidential communications across ICRC m√©tiers and in support of a range of Movement services.

So far, TeleConnect has been used in health, and to support confidential interviewing for restoring family links or missing persons services.

### 2. TELECONNECT IN HEALTH: USER GUIDES FOR HEALTH WORKERS

In the health use case, TeleConnect can be used to connect a health worker to a service user (see the TeleConnect session user guide) or to connect a health worker (the requester) to another health worker or medical expert (the expert) for Tele-expertise.

Tele-expertise is a system whereby a health worker may be seeking a second opinion or clinical decision support or guidance from a health worker more specialized than them. The requesting health worker can connect to an expert either when they are in the consultation with the Service User, or after it is over. The goal of tele-expertise service is to improve quality of care by providing distal access to expert opinion.
