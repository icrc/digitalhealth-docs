#### **Step 3: Test your hardware (if you connect for the rst time)**

Before joining the session, you can quickly check if your camera and microphone are working well.

To do so, you simply click on the button "Test my hardware".

Then, you might need to allow the browser to access to your camera and microphone.

Once allowed, you can start the test.

If the test is successful, you can click on the button "stop the test" and join the session.

You will then land on the session page.

The professional with whom you are connecting automatically receives a notication that you are waiting for them to answer.

The session will remain as "request for teleconsultation in progress" until the professional on the other end connects.

Once the other professional connects, the session starts.

Even before a call comes through, you can start using the chat function, or send images and PDF les if you wish.

### **1.2.2. Receive a call**

> ðŸ–‹ Note&#x20;
>
> To receive a call, you need to be already connected to a session. Check the use case "Join a Consultation" to know more about it.

The person on the other end of the line might need to call you with - _or without_ - the camera.

In this case, you will receive a call - _like on your phone_ - and will need to click on "accept" to start the session with camera and/or microphone.

You can now directly talk to one another.
