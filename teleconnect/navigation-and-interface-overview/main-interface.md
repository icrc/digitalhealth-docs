### 2. TELECONNECT SESSION (GENERAL USER GUIDE)

#### 2. 1. As a requester

A requester is any user wishing to connect with a Service User, colleague or other user

**2. 1. 1. Carry out a remote session without prior planning**

You have decided to start a remote session with a Service User or a colleague using audio, video or using an instant messaging chat.

In this case, you will inform the the person you will connect with, that s/he will receive a session link by SMS, What'sApp or by email so that you may have a session via a secure video or audio call or can write message in a chat.

Here is an example of how it works.

**Step 1: Connect to TeleConnect**

Use [_this link_](https://teleconnect.ext.icrc.org/) to connect to TeleConnect.

The connection is then made through your ICRC credentials.

You will land on the Homepage as below:

**4** TELECONNECT SESSION _(GENERAL USER GUIDE)_

**Step 2: Create the session**

From the Menu "Invites", you click on the button "New invite"

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then, from the window that will pop up, you will select "Remote" service user.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

> ðŸ–‹ Note The other possibility "Service user in person" is meant to allow you to call a colleague while a Service User is next to you, and you need some advice. Which is a different use case.

Once you've clicked on the "invite" button under "Remote service user", you can ll in the form with person's information, and click on "send" to send the invitation (either by email or telephone, depending on the information you indicated in the form)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

> Tip&#x20;

> Select the language of your Service User or colleague, for them to receive the email or What'sApp or SMS in their language

Your Service User or colleague has now received the invitation; You need them to connect to the link they received to be able to start the session in TeleConnect.

It is not possible to open the session before the person who received the invitation connects.

Once your Service User or colleague is online, you will receive a notication (sound ringing), and see them in the waiting room as below:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 3 : Connect to the session**

Once the other person has connected and you hear the notication, you go to the waiting room (if you are not there already), and click on "start next consultation". This is what you should see.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click on start the session.

You can start using the chat function and send photos or PDFs via the chat input eld without starting a video or audio call. Or you can start a call.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 4: End the session**

Make sure that any key points are recorded in the chat, for example in a health use case, the diagnosis recommendation or treatment recommendation if consulting with a specialist.

When you have finished the discussion, you click on "Terminate the session" and you can choose to :

a.) "Close" the case (where it is still possible to come back to the case up to 24h after, however all trace of the call will be deleted after 24h)

b.) "Terminate but keep opened" (where you can come back to the case later to send messages in the chat or make another call)

c.) Stay in the current session to resume the contact.

If you choose to close the case, you can download a pdf of the session (but only the start time and date and what has been written in the chat will be documented).

**2. 1. 2. b. Perform a planned session**

You have decided in advance with the Service User or colleague that a remote session will be organized at a given date and time.

You schedule the session in advance. And connect to it when the scheduled day comes.

**Step 1: Connect to TeleConnect**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Your consultation is now scheduled, and your Service User or colleague has received an email, What'sApp or SMS with the date and time of the consultation, as well as a link to test their device prior to the consultation.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 2: Check your scheduled sessions**

To see your scheduled sessions, open the menu "invites". You will see the list of your sessions that are scheduled or still open.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will see there the scheduled date of each session.

**Step 3: Start the session**

You need your Service User or colleague to connect to the link they received to be able to start the session.

It is not possible to open the session before the other person connects.

Once your Service User or colleague will be online, you will receive a notication (sound ringing), and see them in the waiting room as below:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The waiting room is also available from the Dashboard menu (homepage)

**Step 4: End the session**

Make sure that any key points are recorded in the chat, for example in a health use case, the diagnosis recommendation or treatment recommendation if consulting with a specialist.

When you have nished the discussion, you click on "Terminate the session" and you can choose to :&#x20;

a.) "Close" the case (where it is still possible to come back to the case up to 24h after, however all trace of the call will be deleted after 24h)

c.) Stay in the current session to resume the contact.

If you choose to close the case, you can download a pdf of the session (but only the start time and date and what has been written in the chat will be documented).

**2. 1. 3. c. Invite additional third-party participants**

In some cases you might want to invite a third party into a session, such as an interpreter, another colleague, or a loved one.

For security reasons, this invitation cannot be made during a session already in progress.

It is necessary to create a new invitation to invite a third party.

**Step 1: Create a session**

You can refer to use cases "Carry out a remote session without prior planning" or "Perform a planned session" to see how to create a new consultation.

**Step 2 : Invite a third party**

From the invitation, you can tick the relevant box "invite a loved one or another caregiver", then ll in the email or mobile number of the person to invite.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then, this person will receive the same email or message as the Service User, with the same link to connect to the session.

**2. 1. 4. d. Invite an interpreter into the session**

There are situations where a TeleConnect session is complicated because of a language barrier. In this case, it is possible to invite an interpreter to the session.

**Step 1: Create a session**

You can refer to use cases "Carry out a remote session without prior planning" or "Perform a planned session" to see how to create a new session.

**Step 2 : Invite an interpreter**

You select the Service User's language. If it is not available, it means that there is no interpretation organization that speaks this language, or that it has not been declared in the system.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then, you tick the relevant box " Invite an interpreter " and select the interpreting organization from the list.

> ðŸ–‹ Note The language determines which organization is usable.

Upon validation, an email will be sent to a manager or a distribution list of the interpreting organization.

* In the event that the interpretation request is refused or without a response after 24 hours, an email is automatically sent to the requestor indicating that no interpreter is available.&#x20;
* If the interpreter accepts the request, an email will be sent to them with an invitation link in the same way as the patient.

The third party can join a video call already in progress even if they missed the start of the session.

> âš  Warning
>
> It is strongly recommended, whenever possible, to plan the session in advance to ensure that an interpreter is available. In addition, it is also important to note that no invitation is sent to the beneficiary as long as an interpreter is not available.

#### 2. 2. As a Service User

**2. 2. 1. a. Join a consultation**

**Step 1: Open the link received by email, WhatsApp or SMS**

You have received a link to the consultation either by email, WhatsApp or SMS.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then, you simply click on the link to join the online session.

**Step 2: Read and accept terms and conditions**

After having clicked on the invitation link, a window automatically pops up.

You will need to **read and accept terms & conditions before being able to join the session**.

Once you have ticked the box for terms and conditions, you can click on the button "join the session".

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

> ðŸ—© Advice&#x20;
>
> Please read carefully the terms and conditions, as it is always important to understand how your personal data are used, stored and can be protected. For more information about data protection in TeleConnect, you can refer to the [_Legal actions/data protection_](https://icrc.scenari.eu/~~chain/web/u/itemDynGen/fqkLygWgPp0cWXxPKVUfkB/dkRefDocPre/\(refUri'id\(pseLygWgPp0cWXxPKVUfkB'skin'default'\)/co/!\)id\(pseLygWgPp0cWXxPKVUfkB*3B_Aroot!\)id\(psfLygWgPp0cWXxPKVUfkB*3B_Aroot!\)id\(psfLygWgPp0cWXxPKVUfkB*3B_Aroot!_Nc!\)id\(psfLygWgPp0cWXxPKVUfkB*3B21_Atheme!\)id\(psYLygWgPp0cWXxPKVUfkB*3B_Atheme!\)id\(psYLygWgPp0cWXxPKVUfkB*3B_Atheme!_N10!\)id\(psYLygWgPp0cWXxPKVUfkB*3B76_Atheme!\)id\(psYLygWgPp0cWXxPKVUfkB*3B76_Atheme!_N10!\)id\(psYLygWgPp0cWXxPKVUfkB*3B76_Atheme!_N10!_N2b\)*)

**Step 3: Test your hardware (if you connect for the rst time)**

Before joining the session, you can quickly check if your camera and microphone are working well.

To do so, you simply click on the button "Test my hardware".

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then, you might need to allow the browser to access to your camera and microphone.

Once allowed, you can start the test.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If the test is successful, you can click on the button "stop the test" and join the session.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 4: Wait for the professional to connect**

Now you can click on the button "join the session"

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will then land on the session page.

The professional with whom you are connecting automatically receives a notication that you are waiting for them to answer.

The session will remain as "request for teleconsultation in progress" until the professional on the other end connects.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once the other professional connects, the session starts.

Even before a call comes through, you can start using the chat function, or send images and PDF les if you wish.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**2. 2. 2. b. Receive a call**

> ðŸ–‹ Note&#x20;
>
> To receive a call, you need to be already connected to a session. Check the use case "Join a session" to know more about it.

The person on the other end of the line might need to call you with - _or without_ - the camera.

In this case, you will receive a call - _like on your phone_ - and will need to click on "accept" to start the session with camera and/or microphone.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can now directly talk to one another.

### 3. TELECONNECT IN HEALTH: USER GUIDES FOR HEALTH WORKERS

In the health use case, TeleConnect can be used to connect a health worker to a service user (see the TeleConnect session user guide) or to connect a health worker (the requester) to another health worker or medical expert (the expert) for Tele-expertise.

Tele-expertise is a system whereby a health worker may be seeking a second opinion or clinical decision support or guidance from a health worker more specialized than them. The requesting health worker can connect to an expert either when they are in the consultation with the Service User, or after it is over. The goal of tele-expertise service is to improve quality of care by providing distal access to expert opinion.

#### 3. 1. As a TeleExpertise requester

You may be a health worker in the periphery or in a district hospital and need support during your consultation with the Service User from an expert medical practitioner. Or you may be seeking support with for a case where the Service User is no longer with you, after having carried out a clinical consultation with them. You may be requesting advice ahead of your next appointment. Either way, you are a tele-expertise "requester".

**3. 1. 1. a. Request expert advice**

**Step 1: Connect to the dedicated Tele-Expert webpage**

Use [_this link_](https://teleconnect-request-expert.ext.icrc.org/) to connect to the page dedicated to requesting an expert's advice

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From that page, you can select your language and then click on "Institutional Connection" if you are ICRC staff, or follow the sign-in instructions if you are an external.

> ðŸ—© Advice If you don't have an access yet, please refer to your Health Program Coordinator.

You will land on the page below - that will be empty (as on the screenshot below) if you connect for the first time

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 2: Request Tele-expertise**

From the landing page, click on the button "Request a new session".

It will open a page with the session request form

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From there, you will be able to select the type of expertise you need or the queue you would like your call to be placed in.

Then you will need to indicate the beneciary information.

Once you've added all the relevant information, click on "Request session". The expert will have access to the information you indicated in the form, as well as anything you added in the chat before or during the session with him or her.

It will automatically open a "Tele-Expertise" page.

If you wish to ask for advice in the chat, you can start typing or uploading PDFs or photos. Please note that he expert will not reply if they are not online.

If they don't answer, you can click on "back to dashboard".

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 3: Wait for expert advice**

A call session will start when an expert takes the call. You will need to accept the call by clicking "accept".

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### 3. 2. As an expert doctor

You are an expert who has been recruited to answer requests for support from peripheral health workers. The peripheral health worker may be with a patient so needs to connect in real-time, or they may be needing case advice between consultations with the patient.

**3. 2. 1. Step 1. Log into TeleConnect**

Using the link you have been provided, you should be able to access your TeleConnect account.

You are an expert working on the TeleConnect project and you need to answer a call on a new case from a peripheral health worker who needs help.

**Step 2. Check your waiting room**

Now you have logged in, you can see your dashboard. In this example, you have some open sessions, and you have some cases waiting in your waiting room. If it is the rst time you ever log in or if you have no cases, this will be empty.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click on waiting room and you will see only the cases waiting for you to answer a call, or for your chat reply.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Cases where the peripheral health worker are online and awaiting your response have a green "online" ag under the service user's name.

**Step 3. Open and start a waiting session**

Click on the case to open the session and you will see this screen. Here you see the service user information as well as anything the peripheral health worker has added to the chat.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From here, you can click on "Start the session" at the bottom. Now you will be able to give your advice or ask questions in the chat, add documents or photos, or start a video or audio call if the peripheral health worker is online.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you choose to start a call, the peripheral health worker will hear a ringing sound and his/her screen will show the call to be answered.

**Optional step: Invite a colleague**

It may be that you think it would be benecial to have a 3rd opinion on the case.

To add another colleague to the session, you can click on the "invite a colleague" button. This will bring up a box whereby you can request a colleague to join your session via SMS or email, or you can copy and paste the session link into whatever communication channel you use to contact that colleague (WhatsApp, Signal, Skype etc)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Your colleague will need to click on the link, enter their name and accept the terms of use, accept the use of their camera and microphone, then enter the session. You will see their name just under the requestor's name and whether they are online.

If you request a call, both the requesting peripheral health worker and your expert 2nd opinion will get an audio alert and will be able to join the 3 way call. If not, the three of you will be able to use the chat function.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (34).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**3. 2. 2. b. Close a session**

**You have given your advice and now you would like to close the session**

Click on "Close" or "Terminate the session".

As an expert, you have three choices here:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**a. Close**

You may have provided advice in one call, or over many days or weeks as the case progressed. Once you are sure the service user has a good management plan, you can close the session. This will close the session completely.

**b.Terminate but keep open**

You have nished giving advice for now, but perhaps you are waiting for test results, or to see how a service user responds to a recommended treatment, so it is likely that you will contact the peripheral health worker again in order to make a management plan. This means that the chat or call session is closed, but the case stays open in your "open sessions", which you can access from TeleConnect anytime. You will get an email or SMS notication when there is activity on this case while you were oine.

**c. Stay in the session**

Go back to the session.

**3. 2. 3. c. Consultation report**

**TeleConnect produces a record of the sessions you have managed in a**

**"consultation report"**

As you are providing assistance to a peripheral health worker, it is important to record key information in the chat. **The chat forms the electronic record of the TeleExpertise activity.**

Please record information such as the presentation of the service user, the key reasons why you have advised a particular action and the nal advice you gave, such as what you asked the peripheral health worker to investigate or prescribe.

The treatment plan should always feature at the bottom of the chat before you close the session.

Remember, what you write in the chat will be in the session record document!

Once the session is closed denitively, in the session history area, you will nd a list of the sessions you closed in the last 24 hours only.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you see here, there is a PDF record of that case or consultation, which you can download and add to an electronic medical record or print and add to a paper patient le.

Click on the PDF icon on the left.

Either open the consultation report le from the pop-up in your browser, or go to your le explorer (downloads) to find the file.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Please ensure that once you added or printed the report and added it to the medical record, you remove it from your device by deleting it from your download folder. Try to also clear the cache of your browser around once a week too, for data protection reasons.
