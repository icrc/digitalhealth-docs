Normally the TeleConnect website should adapt to the browser language of the user. If not, select your language from the drop-down list as you log in.

English is the default language in case your language is not included.

The URL to access TeleConnect may be different according to your role:

For schedulers, those scheduling sessions with beneficiaries, or for medical experts who provide medical advice to colleagues, use [https://teleconnect.ext.icrc.org/](https://teleconnect.ext.icrc.org/)

For requesting TeleExpertise from a specialist medical practitioner in a health use case, [https://teleconnect-request-expert.ext.icrc.org/](https://teleconnect-request-expert.ext.icrc.org/)

You will be asked to read and accept the terms of use notice, then log in and you will land on the TeleConect homepage.
