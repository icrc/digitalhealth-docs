Normally the TeleConnect website should adapt to the browser language of the user. If that language is not available in TeleConnect, English is the default language.

The URL to access TeleConnect may be different according to your role:

For schedulers, those scheduling sessions with beneficiaries, or for medical experts who provide medical advice to colleagues, use [https://teleconnect.ext.icrc.org/](https://teleconnect.ext.icrc.org/)

For requesting TeleExpertise from a specialist medical practitioner in the health use, [https://teleconnect-request-expert.ext.icrc.org/](https://teleconnect-request-expert.ext.icrc.org/)

You will be asked to read and accept the terms of use notice, then you will land on the TeleConect homepage.
