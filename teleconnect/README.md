# Introduction

## Overview

A new tool is now available for use transversally: TeleConnect .&#x20;

This tool provides a confidential and secure communication channel that can be used in many cases, e.g., connecting missing persons, for telemedicine or for other confidential communications. Through TeleConnect you can manage sessions with beneficiaries , as well as request an expert's advice when necessary, or connect to colleagues to discuss a beneficiary case for example. Compared to some tools that you might be using today in emergency contexts (Signal, WhatsApp, etc.), TeleConnect provides a better protection for sensitive data.

## Purpose of the guide

This guide should enable the use of TeleConnect, showing users how to use its main features.

## Target audience

TeleConnect can be used to support confidential communications across any ICRC m√©tier and any ICRC or national society-supported service or facility. This guide is aimed at any internal or external user of TeleConnect, including health workers, beneficiaries, protection delegates and national society colleagues.
