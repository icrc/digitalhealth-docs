# Key terms

**Beneficiary/Service User:** These terms are interchangable and mean the individual that is being assisted through an ICRC or national society-supported service, be that health or protection.

**Scheduler:** This is the user who schedules calls, typically with service users but it can be with a colleague.

**Requester:** This is used in the health use case, where a health worker is requesting the expertise of a senior colleague or clinical expert in a TeleExpertise scenario.

**Session:** A TeleConnect session is where the communication concerning a given beneficiary or service user takes place. In a session, one can communicate using audio call, video call or the chat function. Once the session is closed, it can no longer be accessed.

**Waiting Room:** This is where beneficiaries or requesters wait for their call to be answered by the scheduler or by the clinical expert (in the case of TeleExpertise).

**Session history:** This is the area where you can find the sessions that were closed in the last 24 hours.

**Invitation/invite:** This is the process through which a link to a TeleConnect session is sent to a service user.
